Harare provincial magistrate Mrs Vongai Muchuchuti Guwuriro has rolled over to tommorow ruling in the bail application for a Sasai employee who defrauded a commodity broker Simon Seven of his 1,2 million rands in a botched cash transfer deal. Tapuwa Dikanifuniwa is facing fraud charges for the offence. The State led by Mr Owen Safuri had opposed bail on the grounds that the accused was a flight risk and was likely to abscond if granted bail.
Mr Safuri said the accused tried to persuade the investigating officer to withdraw the charges against him. He further stated that the accused was likely to interfere with witnesses. His lawyer Mr Obey Shava argued saying the charges being levelled against his client were mere fabrications. He said the State has failed to give compelling reasons on why the accused should be denied bail. “The risk of interfering with witnesses as alluded to by the State is weak,” he said. Mr Shava further stated that the State has a weak case against the accused person. “The State has failed to discharge the duties as stated in the law,” he said.
Mrs Guwuriro rolled over the matter to tommorow for ruling after indicating that she was overwhelmed.
