I am 16 years old and my friends and I enjoy reading newspapers in order to improve our English during this lockdown period, which made some students to fail their examinations. Reading newspapers gives us information about what is happening around the world. We also share Bible verses to help us know God. Someone encouraged us by saying that if we did not stop reading the Bible and praying, we would have God speaking to us. He said God is the greatest gift of all time. I like the words written on one of our Chitungwiza libraries. It says: “Today a reader and tomorrow a leader”.
