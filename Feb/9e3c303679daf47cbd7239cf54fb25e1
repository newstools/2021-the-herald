However, the 2020 Olympic Games were postponed to this year, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. And, the National Olympic Committee last year pointed out it had some implications on their constitution. According to their constitution, elections should be held no later than eight months after the Games and, therefore, traditionally they are held in April of every year after the Olympics. However, within the same constitution is the provision that an executive, or executive board members, will be elected for a period of up to four years. The board had to take the issue to their constituents where it was agreed they will go ahead with the elections per schedule. And the elections will be held in April.
