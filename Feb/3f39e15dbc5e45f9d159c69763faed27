Last week, Mark Ngwazi’s hit song “Taurai Madzoka” went viral on TikTok, with many fans dancing and imitating the musician through lip syncing. But the only missing link was that the sungura musician did not know about this progressive development. His problem was that his cellphone was outdated, and even if he possessed one, he did not know how to hook up on TikTok.
Now, a group of fans has come to his rescue. They bought him two cellphones, an Itel A56 and a Samsung Note 10 Plus. Above all, the musician received lessons from his management on how to use the cellphone to access the TikTok platform.
So, next time, Mark Ngwazi will never be in the dark as he will be able to easily follow is music’s progress on all platforms. “I am going to open a TikTok account soon, well, after I finish this advert recording I am working on,” said Ngwazi. “By the way I now have two mobile phones donated by my fans.”
