The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo Senior Arts Reporter The 2021 edition for the Star FM Listener’s Choice Awards nominees which was announced last night by United States-based Zimbabwean actor Arnold Tongayi Chirisa have been applauded by some local fans. The awards show which will be held next month will be conducted virtually as the new norm under the Covid-19 restrictions and regulations.
Star FM head of programming, Steve Vickers, said this year’s theme is Respect the Hustle, as in that people should respect the musicians for their hustle they carried in 2020 despite the Covid-19 pandemic. “Our hashtag is “#RespectTheHustle” — it was a tough year, but so much good music was released, and we saw artistes embracing the new normal through online shows and continuing to record music,” he said.
