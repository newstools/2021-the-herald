ZIMBABWE Chess Federation are on a revival path after the Collen Tongowona-led association held the inaugural Piraishe Mabhena Memorial Chess Tournament. The tourney was a success. The virtual tournament saw several chess players taking part and the Mabhena family, who also followed proceedings, said they were happy with the honour the late veteran administrator was given. One hundred and ninety three participants took part. They included participants based in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. Speaking after the tournament, the late Mabhena’s wife, Hilda, said she was surprised by the turnout in support of her husband. ‘’Thank you very much, my family is humbled by the very thought that went into organising the tournament and by those who graced the event,’’ she said. “Sincere thanks to the ZCF.’’ Mabhena’s younger brothers Walter, Arthur and Adonis, entered the fray in the honour of their late brother. Roy Mwadzura and Linda Shaba were crowned men and women champions after they saw off stiff challenges from local and foreign-based players. Mabhena, who was also a football administrator, was the regional chairman for Masvingo. He died on January 1. He had transformed the Masvingo Province Chess Association into one of the best run provincial bodies in the country. Mwadzura was crowned the men’s champion, after amassing an impressive 85 points, while Cyril Chigodo came second with 74 points. Tawanda Zambuko scooped bronze with 67 points while Lloyd Moyo and Tasiso Chikandi came fourth and fifth respectively. In the women category, Shaba won the gold medal as national team players, Christine Makwena and Colletah Wakuruwarewa, took second and third places. Terrence Mureya was the best-placed junior player, finishing in 16th place, and winning the Under-18 title.
