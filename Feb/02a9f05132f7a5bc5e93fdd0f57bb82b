The Herald Manchester. — Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba will be out of action for “a few weeks” with a thigh muscle injury, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has confirmed. France international Pogba was replaced after 39 minutes during Saturday’s 3-3 draw with Everton at Old Trafford. “It’s an injury that will take a few weeks to heal,” Solskjaer told the club’s website on Monday. “Paul has been very important for us and we’re not going to take any risks. (So it is) a few weeks definitely.” The 27-year-old was named the club’s player of the month for January. Pogba will be absent for Tuesday’s FA Cup fifth-round meeting with West Ham on Tuesday and will likely miss both legs of his side’s Europa League last-32 tie against Real Sociedad on 18 and 25 February. — BBC Sport.
