The Herald Nyore Madzianike Senior Court Reporter An employee and a security guard at cement company Lafarge appeared in court yesterday on allegations of releasing 80 bags of impermo compound worth $201 978 from the company’s premises using fake invoices. Cosmas Nyoni and Jacob Chigwenembe, who were being represented by lawyer Ms Sharon Sinyoro and Mr Obey Shava, appeared before Harare magistrate Mrs Yeukai Chigodora. They were not asked to plead to the charges and were remanded out of custody to April 6 on $6 000 bail each. It is alleged that on January 30 this year, Nyoni, a weighbridge clerk, issued an invoice authorising the release of 80 bags of impermo compound from the company. Impermo compound is used to reduce dampness during construction of buildings. Nyoni then connived with Chigwenembe to have the fake invoices stamped before the product was taken out of the company’s premises, without the employer’s knowledge. It is alleged that the compound was released to David Chisango, who operates in Harare’s Central Business District. The offence came to light after an audit, which led to the duo’s arrest and their subsequent appearance in court.
