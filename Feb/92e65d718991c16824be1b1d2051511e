The Herald Sports Reporter SIX Zimbabwean athletes have so far been classified to take part in the track and field at the 12th Fazza International Athletics competition. This is part of the World Para Athletics Grand Prix currently underway in United Arab Emirates. Team Zimbabwe face tough competition, at the meet, where 50 countries have entered the competition, vying to qualify for the Tokyo Games. Zimbabwe, as well as a host of other countries, missed out on qualification events due to Covid-19 lockdown. This presents them with a shot at qualification for the Summer Games. Sixteen-year-old, Pride Tadiwanashe Mafira, will take part in the T44, 100m men and long jump. The blade runner time is within range of qualification. Clement Nyoni competes in the T46, 100m and 400m. Albert Sigele will take part in the T20, 1 500m, 400m as well as long jump. His time, together with that of veteran wheelchair racer Margret Bangajena, who will compete in the T54, 400m and 800m, are also within range. Pamela Vimbai Shumba will participate in T12, 100m and 200m. The 29-year-old sprinter, Vimbai Zvinowanda, who will compete in the 100m and 200m, will get the ball rolling for Team Zimbabwe tomorrow. Zvinowandaâ€™s time is within range and he just needs to repeat the time in Dubai. Zimbabwe is represented by nine athletes, at the event, with some of them competing in the visual impairment events. The Zimbabwean delegation, which travelled to Dubai aboard Emirates on Friday, will have to re-book their return flight, when the competition ends on Sunday. Emirates have suspended their Harare service from February 13 to February 28, 2021, due to operational reasons.
