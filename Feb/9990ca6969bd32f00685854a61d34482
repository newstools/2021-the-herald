ZIMBABWE international defender, Divine Lunga, underlined his good form with a solid show as he helped Golden Arrows upstage giants Orlando Pirates 2-0 in a South African Premiership match in Durban on Tuesday. The roving left back has hit a purple patch and was once again praised by veteran pundit, Mark Gleeson, who was commentating the game on SuperSport. Lunga’s Durban side, at home at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium, scored twice in the second half to beat the Soweto giants, who were coming fresh from their Derby victory. Lunga has been doing well for club and country and had a decent match for the Warriors in November in the AFCON qualifiers against Algeria. The left back is expected to carry his form into next month’s concluding Nations Cup qualifying matches against Botswana and Zambia.
Lunga and his compatriot, Knox Mutizwa, played the entire match. Mutizwa had a chance to score his third goal, in as many games, after 10 minutes but was denied by Buccaneers goalkeeper Richard Ofori. Elsewhere in the DStv Premiership, Amazulu midfielder, Butholezwe Ncube, started for Benni McCathy after the coach gave him a recall to the team.
Usuthu won the seven-goal thriller 4-3 with the fourth and winning goal coming deep in added time. It sparked wild celebrations for McCarthy, who saw his side win for the third time on the bounce.
The former Bafana Bafana hitman has said he wants his men to turn their home into a fortress. In one of the games of the season, Amazulu surrendered a 3-1 advantage, after conceding a last-minute goal, but still had time to snatch the winner from a spectacular free-kick.
