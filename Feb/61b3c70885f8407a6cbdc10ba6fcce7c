MDC-Alliance youth activist and former Zimbabwe National Students Union secretary-general, Makomborero Haruzivishe, yesterday appeared in court on allegations of forcing his way together with others, into Impala Motor Spares and detaining employees, whom they accused of causing the arrest of their colleague Takudzwa Ngadziore last year. Haruzivishe was facing charges of kidnapping, participating in a gathering with intent to commit public violence, and of breaching peace or bigotry, when he appeared before Harare magistrate Sheunesu Matova. His lawyer, Mr Obey Shava told the court that they had complaints against the police and the manner in which his client was arrested. He said Haruzivishe was improperly before the court and was not arrested by police officers, but by individuals in civilian clothing who refused to identify themselves upon arresting him. “These individuals fired gunshots towards the accused person,” said Mr Shava. “The accused was in Sunningdale when he was attending to some IT services and as he was leaving the place, two unmarked double cabs which were parked nearby, blocked his car. Mr Shava said Haruzivishe disembarked from his car to inquire what was happening and the people in the cars started firing shots and ordering him to lie down. Mr Matova rolled over the matter to today for continuation after indicating that he was overwhelmed.
