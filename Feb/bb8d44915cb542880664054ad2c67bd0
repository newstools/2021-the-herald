ZIMBABWE’S Danielle Kaschula produced a fine show yesterday, at the World Rowing Indoor Championships, to claim a bronze medal in the women Under-19, 500m, race. The championships are being held virtually. The 13-year-old, who set five world records during the lockdown last year, managed a podium finish yesterday. Egypt’s Sara Mohamed Zafer Said Elsayed was first in 01:30.2 minutes, followed by Great Britain’s Meg Knight, with a time of 01:30.2 minutes. Kaschula was third in 01:31.1 minutes. Rowing Association of Zimbabwe president, Andrew Lorimer, who rallied the young rower to do well in the event, was impressed with the results. “I am ecstatic with Danielle’s result, third out of 20 rowers in the World Indoor Rowing Championships. And, she is only 13 and was competing with the Under 19 women, most of whom would have been rowing for five years or more. “A great result for Zimbabwe,” said Lorimer. The world competition is featuring more than 900 athletes, from 63 countries. “And, the highly-rated teenage rower is proving she is one for the future, Lorimer said her achievements were a result of hard work and should inspire other young athletes. “It is so exciting for our junior athletes in Zimbabwe, to see what great results can come from putting in the hard work, and training. “It’s also great for Zimbabwe, as it puts our name out there. There are athletes from 63 nations, taking part in the World Indoor Champs. “Lots of people around the world are watching these Championships and will see Zimbabwe’s name. “It’s also exciting that the first, and third in Danielle’s event, were athletes from Africa, with an Egyptian athlete winning the event. “Namibia has a woman athlete who is going to the Olympics and should do well in her race on Saturday and Uganda had a woman athlete who came fifth in a lightweight event yesterday. “Zimbabwean rowing will get better if we have more and more good competition from within Africa,” said Lorimer.
