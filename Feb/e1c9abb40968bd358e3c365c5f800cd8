The Herald Sports Reporter The Vitality Netball Superleague is set to return in the UK with a bang this week after the 2020 season was cancelled with just four rounds played due to the coronavirus outbreak. With the introduction of the Leeds Rhinos franchise, the 11 sides are preparing to battle it out for a place in the semi-finals and a chance to be crowned champions. Teams across England, Scotland and Wales have been sure to secure new talent from around the globe to play alongside some returning Superleague legends. <img class="size-full wp-image-529628" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-11-at-09.53.45.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-11-at-09.53.45.jpeg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-11-at-09.53.45-360x200.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Felisitus Kwangwa But all eyes will be on the Zimbabwe netball team’s captain Felisitus Kwanga who is set to make her debut appearance in the Vitality Superleague after she was snatched by Surrey Storm late last year. Back in 2015 and 2016, Surrey Storm won two consecutive Superleague Grand Finals but since they have not made it to a semi-final, finishing in eighth in the league in 2019 and they will be hoping that they are able to rediscover their form from five years ago. The signing of Zimbabwe captain, Kwangwa for her first season in the Superleague will strengthen their defensive end – the seasoned international was an integral part of Zimbabwe’s first Netball World Cup appearance in 2019. She joins Northern Ireland international Emma Magee and Lauren Tait, who joins from Strathclyde Sirens, for their first season at Surrey Storm.
