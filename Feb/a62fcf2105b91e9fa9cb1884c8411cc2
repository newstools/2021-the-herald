CHITUNGWIZA Ward 23 councillor and general purpose committee chairperson, Question Dingo, today appeared in court for allegedly appointing Alex Mukweva to the position of housing manager when he was on leave pending a disciplinary hearing and when the post had been frozen by the Ministry of Local Government. Dingo, who was being represented by lawyer Mr Jeremiah Bamu, appeared before Harare regional magistrate Mr Ngoni Nduna charged with criminal abuse of duty as a public officer. The State led by Mrs Valerie Ngoma, indicated that Dingo will be jointly charged with suspended Chitungwiza mayor Lovemore Maiko, who is facing same charges. Maiko has since appeared in court and was freed on $5 000 bail coupled with other conditions.
