The Herald LONDON. — Liverpool and Manchester United have been accused of plotting with FIFA and Real Madrid to “DESTROY” football. Spanish La Liga chief Javier Tebas says the “greedy” English Premier League giants have spent months scheming over an “obscene” £4.6billion European Super League. The Spaniard insists United’s US owner Joel Glazer and Liverpool’s John W Henry have been working with Fifa president Gianni Infantino plus Madrid supremo Florentino Perez on plans that will ‘ruin’ the game. Tebas stormed: “This would be a disaster for football, it would destroy the ecosystem and balance of the game in Europe. “This whole underground project started with Infantino and Perez — but the Glazers and Liverpool were active too and held meetings. “They have all tried to keep it secret, before the stories emerged in October and since.” SunSport first revealed plans for a breakaway Euro Super League and how the Big Six have been offered up to £310m in ‘founder-member’ money. That’s on top of a minimum of £130m per season to be part of a closed shop of 20 teams. Tebas says plans could be officially launched next month — with the other 14 Premier League clubs at the risk of losing £3bn between them. He told SunSport: “Is it just about greed? You can define that how you like — but that’s the idea. “This Super League project is going to ruin the Champions League. That’s what they’re looking for. “The Champions League disappears — and the money it generates, they want to divide this up between themselves.” Man Utd legend Gary Neville branded the plans “obscene”, adding: “Football is going to eat itself. — (The Sun)
