The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE Rugby Union have hailed the move by young centre, Thabani “TJ” Maguranyanga, who recently signed a three-and-half year deal with top French club ASM Clermont Auvergne. Maguranyanga, who has a strong background playing in the South Africa rugby schools system, could represent the Sables in the near future. He moved to France from St Stithians Boys College in South Africa, which has also been home to top players like Brian Habana, who was named in the World Rugby 15’s Team of the Decade. ZRU chief executive, Sifiso Made, said he was still waiting for the finer details about the move and hailed Maguranyanga for representing the game well. “I am not in a proper position to comment on anything as yet but, if it is true, then congratulations to him as it will be a plus for us,’’ said Made. “We are happy that most of our players are managing to make the grade in competitive leagues. “I think, as ZRU, we will be active in clearing him but I have not heard anything, as yet, so I cannot comment any further.” Maguranyanga, who moved to South Africa six years ago, will need to be tied down by ZRU if they want him to represent the Sables. Several top local players have chosen to represent South Africa and the teenager, who has already been capped at the Zimbabwe Under-18 side, could also follow suit. The speedster signed a pre-contract with one of the leading top sides, which plays in the Top 14, the highest level of the French league system, on January 9. Maguranyanga is the son of former Warriors fitness trainer, Gerald, was targeted by several top European leagues. But, his management team of Kyros Sports and top Australian agency, Halo Sports, settled for the French League side. Clermont Auvergne are a French rugby union club from Clermont-Ferrand in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes. They are two-time French champions, having won the title in the 2009-10 and 2016-17 seasons.
