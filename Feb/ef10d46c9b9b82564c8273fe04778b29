There have been no incidents of harassment of villagers by military personnel in Gokwe-Nembudziya and media reports on those allegations are unfounded, police have said. Gokwe-Nembudziya legislator Cde Justice Mayor Wadyajena said the reports were false and meant to perpetuate the extension of sanctions by the European Union (EU) and the United States (US). The EU is meeting this month to review the embargoes and the false report appears to be calculated to influence the bloc’s decisions. Chief police spokesperson, Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi, said investigations had shown that no such incidents had taken place in Nembudziya or any other place. “We have read those reports from the media and our subsequent investigations showed that there were no such incidents of harassment of villagers by soldiers,” he said. “We have not received any reports or complaints to that effect in that area or any other place and we wonder what the motive could be.” Cde Wadyajena said he was shocked to read about the alleged military brutality with the report being attributed to Midlands Senator Maybe Mbowa. A local private daily newspaper claimed soldiers were on the rampage harassing shoppers and villagers. “I wish to categorically dissociate Gokwe Nembudziya constituency from the mischievous and poisonous comments recently made by Senator Maybe Mbowa on fictional military brutalities in Nembudziya constituency,” said Cde Wadyajena. “I take great exception to this sinister plot to ruin the image of the Government and His Excellency President Mnangagwa,” he said.
