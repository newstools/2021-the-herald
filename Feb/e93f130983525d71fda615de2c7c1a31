The Herald MELBOURNE. — Serena Williams withdrew from an Australian Open tennis tune-up tournament citing a right shoulder injury yesterday just hours after setting up a semi-final match against top-ranked Ash Barty. The 23-time Grand Slam champion usually doesn’t play in a tournament in the week before a Grand Slam event but made an exception before the US Open last year and for this Australian Open because of all the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Before withdrawing, Williams said she was looking forward to the semi-finals. “It’s definitely a good opportunity to see where I’m going against the current No. 1, that’s really important for me,” Williams said. “Obviously I think for her, as well, to see where she’s going against my game.  “It’s been a long 12 months. Tennis has been played but not really, so . . . hopefully this is like a new year where things will be different.” Garbine Muguruza beat defending Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin 6-2, 6-2 to advance to the semifinals, reversing the result of their 2020 final at Melbourne Park. She will next play No. 8 Marketa Vondrousova. Two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka rallied from two breaks down in the first set and had to save two match points in the match tiebreaker before beating Yulia Putintseva 6-4, 1-6, 11-9 to advance at the Grampians Trophy, an event staged for the players forced into hard lockdown during the quarantine. — AFP.
