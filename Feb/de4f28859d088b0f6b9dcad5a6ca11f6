THE Rainbow Amateur Netball League have indicated that they are still to come up with new dates for their elective general meeting due to the ongoing lockdown. Ranl secretary-general Moses Gukurume said while they had wanted to hold the meeting early in the year, the environment has not been conducive and with the extension of the lockdown, they will keep monitoring the situation. “The AGM was postponed indefinitely due to the issue of lockdown. We discovered that it’s not feasible to do a virtual one because we might disfranchise some of our participants. Some may not have the resources to access the virtual meeting. “So we are going to monitor the landscape, when the Government says it’s safe we then proceed. So that is the agreement from everyone. “The AGM was supposed to have happened by January 31 or early February, that was our target,” said Gukurume. The deadline for nomination submission had been set for January 15, however, all has been put on hold. “We instructed our members to wait on the submissions but can continue with the campaigning…We had already sent out the notice so when the situation permits we can just give them a week to submit the nominees,” added Gukurume. Those nominated will be vying for the chairperson, vice-chairperson, secretary-general, vice secretary-general, treasurer, fixtures secretary and organising secretary posts. The outgoing executive led by Melody Garikai came into office in 2018 and their mandate came to an end at the end of last year. Gukurume indicated he is not interested in seeking re-election for a second term in office. “All things being equal, if nothing comes up I would like to give others a chance. We have had the saying of unfinished business but I believe I can still advise from the sidelines.  Unless there is something compelling I think it’s time to give others the chance,” said Gukurume.
