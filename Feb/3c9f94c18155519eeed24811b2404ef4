The Herald Rumbidzayi Zinyuke Manicaland Bureau Government and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) are working together in constructing 674 transitional shelters for people displaced by Cyclone Idai in Chimanimani and Chipinge. The programme, which will cost US$284 000, will see 200 shelters being constructed in Chipinge, 200 for communities in Chimanimani and another 224 for those living in tents. Speaking at the launch of the distribution of the materials for the transitional shelter, Local Government and Public Works Minister July Moyo said the programme was important in restoring the hope and dignity of those affected by the disaster. He urged the Chimanimani Rural District Council to facilitate the swift allocation of stands to the beneficiaries. “The project that has brought us here today is meant to provide better shelter for survivors of the Cyclone Idai-induced disaster and to de-congest the population currently in camps for internally-displaced persons in order to curb local transmission if the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said recently. The transitional shelters being provided by IOM will be two-roomed prefabricated structures to be constructed at the site where permanent structures are being constructed. Over 50 houses have so far been constructed at West End Farm in Bumba. Funds for a further 70 houses have been released and work is expected to start soon. Cyclone Idai slammed Manicaland and parts of Masvingo provinces in March 2019 and the damage it caused has not been completely addressed.
