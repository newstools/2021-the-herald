The Herald WASHINGTON. — Former President Donald Trump will never be allowed back on Twitter, even if he runs for office again in 2024 and wins, company chief financial officer Ned Segal told CNBC. “The way our policies work, when you’re removed from the platform, you’re removed from the platform,” Segal told CNBC on yesterday, adding that bans are permanent “whether you’re a commentator, you’re a CFO, or you are a former or current public official.” The news came as Trump’s impeachment trial is taking place in the Senate, on a charge that he incited an insurrection with his inflammatory exhortations at a rally in Washington immediately prior to the breach of the US Capitol by a murderous mob on 6 January. When he was impeached last year, he tweeted criticism throughout, although then, and now, he declined to appear at the trial in his own defence. The suspension was criticised heavily by the former president’s supporters, and by free speech advocates. A poll last week found that 45 percent of Republican voters would support a run for the presidency by Trump in 2024, down from 65 percent in December. Trump will first have to be acquitted by the Senate in the ongoing impeachment trial to avoid being barred from office. Furthermore, without his social media megaphone, he would be denied one of his favourite and most effective means of communication. — CNBC.
