The Herald Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE Boxing Board and Wrestling Control board secretary-general, Lawrance Zimbudzana, says super flyweight champion Revai Madondo’s triumph in Tanzania is a huge boost in her career. Madondo, who returned home on Tuesday, was welcomed back by representatives from the board and her sponsors, Stanzee Drilling. Zimbudzana thanked the Shurugwi-born 25-year-old pugilist for raising the national flag high and encouraged her to continue working hard. She is set to battle Mariela Ribera Vaverde of Argentine in a WBO title fight in April. “We are very grateful for Madondo, and all her supporting staff, we need to have more boxers representing the country at such a high level,’’ said Zimbudzana. “As a board, we are happy and we hope she will continue to boost her profile. “Winning away from home is always difficult, in boxing, and it is through hard work that she managed to just do that, despite training under these difficult Covid-19 conditions. “We are expecting her to submit her future plan and see where we can come up with a helping hand.’’
