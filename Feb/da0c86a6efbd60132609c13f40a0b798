SENEGALESE giants ASC Jaraaf have arrived in Harare for the CAF Confederation Cup group stage play-off tie against FC Platinum. The West Africans, who left Dakar yesterday morning, touched down at the Robert Mugabe International Airport around 2pm, on Wednesday afternoon. They immediately checked into their hotel, to rest, after spending close to 30 hours on a trip that took them via Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. They are likely to have their first training session tomorrow. The Dakar-based outfit are coming on the back of a promising league campaign, at home, where they have won their last three matches on the bounce to assume pole position after six games. They face FC Platinum in the first leg of the CAF Confederation Cup play-off at the National Sports Stadium this Sunday. The return leg is set for February 21 at the multi-purpose Stade Demba Diop in Dakar.
