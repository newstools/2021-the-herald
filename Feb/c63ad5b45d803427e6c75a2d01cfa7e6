The Herald BEIJING. — BBC World News was yesterday banned from broadcasting in China, according to the Chinese state media outlet CGTN. China’s National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) said some of the BBC’s reports infringed the principles of truthfulness and impartiality in journalism. The broadcasting regulator released a statement accusing the BBC of seriously violating regulations “on radio and television management, and on overseas satellite television channel management in its China-related reports.” It went on to say that BBC reporting had “undermined China’s national interests and ethnic solidarity” before announcing the broadcasting ban. “As the channel fails to meet the requirements to broadcast in China as an overseas channel, BBC World News is not allowed to continue its service within Chinese territory. The NRTA will not accept the channel’s broadcast application for the new year.” The Chinese English language newspaper, Global Times, wrote on Twitter: “#Opinion: China has sent the outside world a clear signal that it has zero tolerance for fake news by banning the broadcast of BBC World News in Chinese mainland. BBC has chosen to be a rumourmonger against China, then it has to bear the consequences.” — NWorld.
