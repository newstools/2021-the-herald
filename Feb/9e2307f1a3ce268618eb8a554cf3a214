ZIMBABWEAN defenders, Teenage Hadebe and Alec Mudimu, continue to prove their mettle in foreign lands after they were named in the Team of the Week in the top two tiers of Turkish league football. Hadebe was included in the Turkish Super League best XI after he featured in Yeni Malatyaspor’s goalless draw against Faith Karagumruk. Mudimu, who recently moved to second tier side, Ankaraspor, was also named in the Team of the Week, for the first time, following the 1-0 win over mid-table side, Keciorengucu. The defender has played only two games and has helped his side keep clean sheets in both matches. The towering duo is expected to hold the fort when Zimbabwe conclude their AFCON qualifying campaign against Botswana and Zambia in March. The Warriors are second in Group H with five points.  Group leaders Algeria have since qualified to the finals of the tournament with two rounds of play remaining.
