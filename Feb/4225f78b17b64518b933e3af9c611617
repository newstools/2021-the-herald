ZIMBABWE football kings FC Platinum have scaled up their preparations for the CAF Confederation Cup against Senegal’s ASC Jaraaf. The platinum miners began a bubble camp in Harare this week as part of the recommendations from the Government and health experts in the efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus. They are looking to acclimatize with the playing conditions at the National Sports Stadium where they host the first leg of the group stage qualifying play-off next week on Sunday. “The team arrived safely in the capital to set up camp and continue with training ahead of the CAF Confederation Cup first leg encounter against ASC Jaraaf of Senegal slated for the 14th of February 2021,” the club said in a statement. The Zvishavane side are hoping to maximize on the time they have in their hands. Their request to begin training, under the country’s lockdown rules, was granted a week later than the schedule. FC Platinum, who are led by a medical doctor, Fabian Mashingaidze, have been religiously implementing the coronavirus health guidelines in their efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19. The club is expected, among other things to facilitate mandatory testing of all players and officials, establish a minimum 10-day bubble camp and appoint a Covid-19 Compliance Officer to ensure full compliance with Covid-19 national and international protocols. The first leg has been set for February 14 at the National Sports Stadium with the return leg penciled in for the following week at the multi-purpose Stade Demba Diop in Dakar.
