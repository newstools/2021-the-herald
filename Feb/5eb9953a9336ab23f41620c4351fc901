The Herald Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter VISITING Pakistan women’s cricket team head coach, David Hemp, is keen to build on the positives from their recent tour of South Africa when they face Zimbabwe next week. The tourists arrived in Harare on Thursday evening, on the back of an eight-run win over the South Africans, in their last T20I. They suffered a 0-3 whitewash in their One Day International series before registering a 2-1 defeat in the T20Is. They will now clash with Zimbabwe in three one-dayers and as many T20 matches starting from next Tuesday. “There have been some positives — both individually and collectively — upon which we will be building on in Zimbabwe and future series. “The girls fought hard and played good, competitive cricket in chunks but struggled to get over the line, which we can overcome with more competitive cricket that the tour of Zimbabwe brings us. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-528646" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-05-at-12.54.42.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-05-at-12.54.42.jpeg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-05-at-12.54.42-360x200.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “This is a young and energetic side which has some impressive players emerging who possess the desired talent,” said Hemp. The Pakistan women’s team are in Zimbabwe on their first international tour to the country. The two teams are expected to face off in three 50-over matches and as many T20Is at the Harare Sports Club as part of their preparations for the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier to be held later in the year. The tournament will feature 10 teams with only the top three, from that qualifying event, progressing to the 50-over ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2022 in New Zealand. The Pakistan tour of Zimbabwe will start earlier than initially scheduled after the two cricket boards agreed to play an additional T20I match. “In an exciting development, Zimbabwe and Pakistan have agreed to add one more Twenty20 international (T20I) match to the women’s white-ball series which is set to get underway at Harare Sports Club next week,” said ZC spokesperson Darlington Majonga in a statement. “This means the two sides will now clash in three T20I games and as many one-day matches. “The additional match has necessitated a rescheduling of the itinerary, with the first game of the tour, a 50-over encounter, now pencilled in for 9 instead of 11 February. “The other two one-day matches will be played on 12 and 14 February. The three T20Is have been scheduled for 17, 19 and 20 February. “The series — which will mark the first time the Zimbabwe senior women’s team will be involved in international cricket since May 2019 — will be held in a bio-secure bubble with no spectators allowed at the match venue.” ZC have assembled a squad that is currently in camp in Harare. The players have been split into two selects —  Northern and Southern — from where the selectors are expected to pick the final squad after a couple of practice games. Zimbabwe/Pakistan tour schedule: 9 Feb — first 50-over match, Harare Sports Club 11 Feb — second 50-over match, Harare Sports Club 13 Feb — third 50-over match, Harare Sports Club 16 Feb — 1st T20I, Harare Sports Club 18 Feb — 2nd T20I, Harare Sports Club 20 Feb — 3rd T20I, Harare Sports Club
