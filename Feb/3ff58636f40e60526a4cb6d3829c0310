The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter TOP Zimbabwean amateur golfer, Kieran Vincent, was outstanding as he helped his Liberty University finish second at the 2021 Sea Best Invitational. The Flames were runners-up to North Carolina’s Duke University, at the tournament hosted at the challenging TPC Sawgrass, Dye’s Valley Course (par 70, 6,790 yards). TPC Sawgrass is the sister course to the famed TPC Sawgrass, Stadium Course, the home to The Players Championship, on the PGA Tour. The challenging course played at nearly six strokes over par (75.83 scoring average). Duke (284-300-289) were ahead of Liberty (291-293-289) despite both teams finishing the event with a 33-over par 873. However, it was Vincent, who paced the way for Liberty University, for the second event in a row, finishing with a four-over par 214 (68-71-75). Vincent claimed his 15th career top-10 finish, by ranking second in the field, with 13 birdies during the tournament. The former St John’s College student was helped by teammate, Alexandre Fuchs, who finished the event tied for 11th place, with a seven-over par 217. Another Flames player, Ervin Chang, was tied 14th at 10-over par 220 (74-75-71) and Jonathan Yaun was in 23rd place, at 12-over par 222 (76-76-70). The Flames return to the field this afternoon at the 2021 Gator Invitational Presented by VyStar. The tournament will be hosted by the par 70, 6 701 yard Mark Bostick Golf Course in Gainesville, in Florida.
