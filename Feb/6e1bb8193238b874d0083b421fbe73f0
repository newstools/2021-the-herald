The Herald Herald Reporter  The weather is today expected to be mostly sunny and hot in most parts of the country with Matabeleland South and Masvingo to be sunny and mild at first becoming cloudy and warm later with scattered thunderstorms.  The Meteorological Services Department has said there was a heightened risk for lightning strikes.  “Flooded rivers remain a potential hazard; even if it has not rained heavily in the area. Heavy rains may have occurred upstream. Flash flooding may occur especially in wetlands and near river plains.  “Heavy downpours may reduce visibility and flood dangers become difficult to perceive during heavy rains, said the MSD daily update.  The department noted that sunny morning skies may allow a few outdoor activities such as weeding, applying fertilisers or even hanging laundry.  The public has been warned to avoid isolated shed, trees, and even the kitchen area especially in rural setting as these are usually prone to lightning strikes.
