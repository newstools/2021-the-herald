Precious Teya (26) was not asked to plead to the charges when she appeared before Harare provincial magistrate Mrs Vongai Guwuriro, who remanded her in custody to April 21.

Upon arrival, Teya allegedly asked the boy to pay US$20 for the taxi and later gave him the sleeping tablets. It is said that the boy asked Teya to return to Chitungwiza, but she allegedly refused and  forced herself on the boy. Allegations are that Teya had was intimate with the boy once with protection and started demanding US$120 for the services. The matter came to light after the boy asked for US$120 from a neighbour to settle Teya’s bill. The neighbour then called the boy’s grandmother, and explained what had happened.
