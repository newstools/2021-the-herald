The Herald Conrad Mupesa Mashonaland West Bureau  A 16-year-old Chinhoyi girl was fined $15 000 by the courts for violating Government’s Covid-19 curfew recently. The girl who was arrested by security while loitering late into the night with two unidentified men also faces jail term if she fails to pay the fine. Blessing Macharika was on Monday found guilty of contravening Section 25 (2) of Statutory Instrument (SI) 10/21 which pertains to “disobeying curfew orders and regulations” by Chinhoyi magistrate Ms Melody Rwizi. She was also convicted for breaching Section 4 (i)(a) of SI 83/20 that criminalises unnecessary movement during the national lockdown. The girl pleaded guilty and was fined $15 000 expected to be paid by the 15th day this month. She however faces 60 days in jail if she fails to pay the fine. Ms Rwizi set aside 30 days for the next two years on condition she does not commit a similar offence. It is the State’s case that on 28 January 2021 at around 11pm, Blessing was roaming at Gadzema main bus terminus, Chinhoyi while in the company of two unidentified men. Upon spotting security officers on patrol, the trio started running away prompting the officers to pursue them leading to the arrest of Blessing while the two men escaped. She was taken to Chemagamba Police Station where she was charged for breaching Covid-19 pandemic aimed at arresting the spiralling cases. In her ruling, Ms Rwizi said harsh penalties on violators of the national curfew order and lockdown regulations should be passed in order to discourage offenders. Mr Nyasha Sibesha prosecuted.
