CHINA based Zimbabwean Chinyakare artist Brity Yonly has dedicated her award to her fans after scooping the Best Chinyakare/ Chimurenga artist of the Year in the 2021 PPC Zimbabwe Music Awards. Brity Yonly, real name Whitney Mativanga, was nominated together with Vimbai Zimuto, Fusion S and Terrence Kwenda. Her song Vachabaiwa which was released last year went viral on the airwaves and created a #vachabaiwa challenge among dance groups making her nominated for the awards. She said she was thrilled to have won the award before dedicating it to her fans, management and fellow nominees. “I am so excited about this award because it was a huge honour and career defining moment for me in my musical journey,” she said. “I am so grateful for this award and I am dedicating it to my loyal fans, management and fellow nominees because without your input this would be impossible. Unfortunately, in the race one winner will emerge at the end but I really appreciate and respect your craft.” Brity Yonly started her musical journey at the age of 9 when she would compose and write songs for school and church. She said she later started recording in 2011 when she was in Lower 6 before joining The Blacks Afro contemporary band as a lead vocalist in 2013. In 2015 she released 6 track a duet album titled Mwana WaMambo with her friend WeDande. “In 2018, I toured Europe where I performed at Bergen Afro Arts Festival in Norway. In 2019, I released a single titled Fame without Money and I left Zimbabwe to perform in China where I am currently based. In 2020 I released Vachabaiwa which won the PPC ZIMA award for the Best Chinyakare/ Chimurenga category,” said Brity Yonly.
