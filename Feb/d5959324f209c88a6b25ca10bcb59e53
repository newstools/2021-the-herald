The Herald Herald Reporter A number of corporates have approached Government to assist in the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines following an invitation for private players to help in the purchase of the life-saving jabs, Health and Child Care Deputy Minister, Dr John Mangwiro, said while responding to questions from legislators in the National Assembly on Wednesday. He said while corporates were free to import vaccines of their choice if registered locally, the process would be done through the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. “Private players like medical aid societies (Cimas), and other corporates like Econet, have already approached the ministry with the wish to help out and we have said they are welcome; they bring in their money, tell us the type of vaccine they want, but they buy via Government so that what they want to buy is registered in the country,” he said. Dr Mangwiro said Government would also ensure that vaccines brought into the country are safe, stored properly and would be distributed through traditional channels. He said the Ministry of Finance had opened an account for private players who wish to procure vaccines. Vaccination of MPs began on Wednesday at Parliament Building.
