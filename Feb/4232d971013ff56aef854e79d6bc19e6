Posting on all her social media sites, Manyowa said: “We have discovered that someone has been imitating our YouTube account with a fake Janet Manyowa profile. “This would explain the unsolicited messages you have received over the last couple of days pertaining to prophecies and monetary donations. Kindly note these messages were not from us. Thank you to all those who sought clarity directly from us. Stay safe, stay at home.” Contacted for comment, Manyowa’s manager Munya said it was devastating because they will end up losing trust from their fans. “Yes, it has come to our attention that a fake Janet Manyowa account has been created,” he said. “A lot of things are happening on the internet and social media these days and everyone is using the platforms to remain vigilant and wary of hackers, scammers and internet fraudsters.” <img class="wp-image-479600 size-large" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/Mahendere-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/Mahendere.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/Mahendere-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Micheal Mahendere Minister Mahendere also fell victim to the fraudsters. “Please be careful,” he said. “Do not ask or approach anyone seeking for donations or praying over you on any of our public platforms or through private messaging on social media. Please stay vigilant.”
Tembalami said something must be done urgently to deal with the scammers. “I have alerted my fans, friends and family over the scams,” he said. “Something needs to be done. This is not the first time and some people are making money out of it because we are seen as role models in the community, hence it is easy to believe us.
“We have never asked for any donations or money from anyone.”
Last week, a man appeared at the magistrate’s courts in Harare for creating fake accounts in the name of urban grooves musician Trevor Dongo and conning some people through them.
