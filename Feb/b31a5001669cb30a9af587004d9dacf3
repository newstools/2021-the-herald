Fifty-nine people have drowned in January alone this year mainly because of crossing flooded rivers, police have said. While the number is lower than the 71 recorded in January last year, police are worried about the statistics and continue to implore citizens to be safety conscious and avoid crossing, fishing or allowing children to play in water bodies. Heavy rains pounding most parts of the country have seen some people taking chances to cross flooded rivers, either on foot or using vehicles, resulting in them being swept away. In a statement yesterday, national police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said of the 59 drowning cases recorded in January this year, 49 were males while 10 were females. This comes as 483 drowning cases were reported all of last year compared 411 in 2019. Of the 483 cases, 26 were recorded in Harare province, Bulawayo 7, Midlands 54, Manicaland 55, Masvingo 55, Matabeleland North 30, Matabeleland South 31, Mashonaland East 58, Mashonaland Central 70 and Mashonaland West 97. Asst Comm Nyathi said cases of drowning occur mostly when people attempt to cross flooded rivers, streams and other water points. He added that children drown while playing or swimming in rivers, trenches and other water sources while some adults engage in fishing escapades using dingy boats or crafts that are not safe. Some people have also drowned while trying to cross rivers and streams using homemade boats
