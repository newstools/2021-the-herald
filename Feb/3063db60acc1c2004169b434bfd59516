The Herald LONDON. — Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is past his best and looks “like he has lost his superpower”, Jamie Redknapp has claimed in a damning verdict of the Arsenal forward. This followed his below-par display in defeat against Manchester City. Aubameyang was a peripheral figure throughout as Arsenal lost 1-0 against Pep Guardiola’s City on Sunday. The Gabonese striker was in scintillating form last season, scoring 29 goals in all competitions and earning himself a lucrative £350 000-a-week deal in September — but has largely looked a shadow of that player this term. Aubameyang (31) had rediscovered his best form in front of goal last weekend when he netted a hat-trick against Leeds, but was completely ineffectual against City — and Redknapp believes the striker has lost his mojo. He said on Sky Sports: “Aubameyang’s past his best. He could have moments, he’s going to get his hat-tricks. “When I watch him sometimes it’s like he’s lost his superpower. You used to see him run past people when he first came into the English Premier League, I’ve seen him run past people at Dortmund. — Mailonline.
