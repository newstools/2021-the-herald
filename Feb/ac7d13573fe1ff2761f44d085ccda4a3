Government and various partners have scaled up distribution of relief aid to vulnerable people in all the districts in Mashonaland West. As at February 2, the cumulative distributions for the period were 795 tonnes comprising of 781 tonnes of maize and 13 tonnes of sorghum. Speaking to The Herald recently, provincial social development officer Mrs Agnes Mutowo said her department and other partners were providing drought relief assistance to 172 177 households since January. Despite the ravaging effects of Covid-19 and inaccessibility of some roads damaged by incessant rains and flooding the distribution exercise, she said, was on-going. She said other partners that were distributing food aid in the province included Red Cross, CARE, World Vision among other organisations. “Our distributions stand at 795 tonnes of maize and sorghum. Since January, Government has been distributing grains to all the districts and has been the major distributor. The other partners are distributing small grains, cereal and vegetable oils,” said Mrs Mutowo. Hurungwe, Sanyati, Kariba, Mhondoro Ngezi and Zvimba are currently facing critical food shortages as a result of the El Nino induced drought experienced in previous cropping seasons. “In Hurungwe, we have a target of 31 155 households and already 25 521 have received 274 tonnes of relief aid, 5 840 Sanyati households from a target of 14 184 have also received 82 tonnes grains. “Kariba’s 4 960 households have also benefitted 58 tonnes from the target households of 5 832 while 15 936 households from 32 966 in Zvimba received 177 tonnes of aid as well,” she said. Government, she said, has also distributed 46, 5 tonnes of mealie-meal to 2 261 households in Zvimba while thousands of households in Kariba are also expected to benefit. “We are also working with implementing partners like the World Food Programme in our districts.”
