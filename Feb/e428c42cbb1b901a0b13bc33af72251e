The Herald Crime Reporter Police have arrested a 38-year-old suspected fraudster on allegations of swindling a city company of more of fuel worth over US$108 000. Adam Horton, who had been on the run since April last year, was arrested yesterday and is expected to appear in court today. He was arrested following a raid on his hideout at the intersection of Enterprise and Ridgeway roads. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the arrest saying: “Adam Horton has been arrested in connection with a fuel deal under which he was supposed to supply 200 000 litres of fuel worth US$108 978 but did not deliver the consignment to the complainant within seven days as agreed,” he said. Horton is said to have only delivered 40 000 litres of fuel under the deal before disappearing. Sources close to the investigation said Horton approached the complainant on the pretext that he was going to supply the complainant with cheaper fuel compared to other suppliers. This resulted in the complainant making various payments between April and June last year. Horton took the money and disappeared until word got around that he was hiding at premises owned by a local  businesswoman. Sources said police recently raided the hideout and were told that Horton was not there. Police are now keen to question the businesswoman.
