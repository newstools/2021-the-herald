Noma and I are friends, we are not dating, she was featuring on my video. My relationship remains private, for now let us not talk about that,” he said.  The musician said the new release “Handidi Zvekumitisa” was inspired by lobola settings.  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-529014" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-08-at-09.23.58.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-08-at-09.23.58.jpeg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-08-at-09.23.58-360x200.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “People should just do the right thing. Get married first and the rest follow. I have seen of late that most couples rush to have babies without marrying, which somehow is their choice, but it is good to marry first,” he said.
