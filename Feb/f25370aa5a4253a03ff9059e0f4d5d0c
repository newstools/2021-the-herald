The Herald George Maponga in Masvingo Embattled Masvingo City Engineer Tawanda Gozo has been suspended from office for six months over failure to fix nagging water challenges that have been blighting the ancient city since late last year Engineer Gozo’s suspension is with immediate effect and he will not receive any salary and benefits during that period. According to a letter to Engineer Gozo dated February 5, seen by The Herald, town clerk Engineer Edward Mukaratirwa said the suspension was merited by the “deterioration in the quantity and quality of water “supplied in the city since December last year. He said Engineer Gozo’s suspension is in terms of Section 140(3)(a) and 140(7)(a) of the Urban Councils Act. “Council expects you to cooperate whenever information is required from you during investigations and for day to day operations,” read the letter to Engineer Gozo. He has also been ordered to do a handover and takeover with another official who will act during his suspension. The world started collapsing around Engineer Gozo early this year after he was fingered for failure to address nagging water woes in Masvingo. Residents and stakeholders blasted council for failure to help complement Government in the Covid-19 fight by failing to supply water resulting in some suburbs going to weeks with dry taps. The anger was compounded by that Lake Lake Mutirikwi which supplies Masvingo water is currently over 70 percent full.
