The Herald ROME. — Fourth faces third in the Italian Serie A today with hosts Juventus very much in the ascendancy and looking to overtake an AS Roma side facing problems on and off the pitch. Victory in Turin will see Juve leapfrog Roma into third spot with the Italian champions, after an uncharacteristically slow start to the season, finally hitting top gear. Since their defeat by Inter Milan on January 17 — a performance coach Andrea Pirlo described as the “worst of my time here so far” — Juventus have won five games in a row in all competitions, conceding once. “We weren’t in that (Inter) game, but it served as a lesson for us,” Pirlo said of that loss after exacting revenge with a 2-1 Coppa Italia semi-final first-leg win at the San Siro on Tuesday. “From there we regrouped, worked on the errors and more victories arrived.” All is not quite as rosy at Roma.
