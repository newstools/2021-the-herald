The Herald Court Reporter SUSPECTED fraudster Adam Phillip Horton (38), alleged to have duped a local fuel firm of 201 000 litres worth US$108 978, will spend the weekend in custody after the court deferred his bail hearing to Monday. Horton, represented by Advocate Eric Matinenga, appeared before Harare regional magistrate Mr Ngoni Nduna charged with fraud, with the State led by Mr Lancelot Mutsokoti opposed to bail on the grounds he could interfere with witnesses and might abscond once freed on bail. Mr Mutsokoti called the investigating officer, Don Obey Mutambo, to give evidence against granting Horton bail. “When accused committed this offence he switched off his phone and went to a new address,” said Mutambo. “We visited the address on December 18, 2020 and left a note. His lawyer promised that he would come to our office, but he never did. His character is that he is someone who does not respond to simple instructions. “Accused and complainant, Gerrad Antony Peters, are childhood friends, so there is a likelihood that he will interfere with witnesses because he is known to the family of the complainant.” Mutambo said Horton now stayed with his girlfriend and there was proof of transfers of money from Mr Peters’ bank account. It is alleged that in June last year, Horton supplied Mr Peters’ company with fuel and told him he could deliver another 201 000 litres. Between June 15 and 25 of last year, Mr Peters’ company allegedly paid US$108 978 and Horton acknowledged receipt of payment. Allegations are that after receiving payment, Horton became evasive and later delivered just 40 000 litres, with further engagements to recover the remaining fuel being fruitless, so Mr Peters lodged a complaint. Horton is expected back in court on Monday for continuation of bail application.
