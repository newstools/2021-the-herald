A 16-year-old boy of no known fixed abode yesterday appeared in court on allegations of holding MDC Alliance activist Paddington Japajapa at knife point in the Central Business District while demanding $20. The teenager was facing theft charges when he appeared before a Harare magistrate. He was remanded in custody to March 10 after the State led by Mr Moses Mapanga requested that he undergoes mental examination. The court heard that on February 22,  Japajapa was walking along George Silundika Avenue near Herald House when the boy suddenly pounced on him holding a knife and demanded$20.
