The Herald lONDON. — Manchester City moved 10 points clear of defending Premier League champions Liverpool with a superb 1-4 victory at Anfield yesterday and still have a game in hand. City are on a 13-game winning run, while Liverpool’s injury crisis has seen them slip to seven points behind the Blues. With Manchester United dropping points again yesterday, City can make more ground on both of their main title rivals with victory today. However, City have not won at Anfield in the league since 2003, and know Jurgen Klopp’s men always make life difficult for them. With Sergio Aguero, Kevin De Bruyne and Nathan Ake still out, Pep Guardiola will go with the same players who have gone 20 games without defeat. A tense first half saw City second best, but shuold have taken the lead when Ilkay Gundogan blazed a penalty over the bar. Gundogan soon made amends, though, as he converted at the start of the second half, but Mo Salah levelled the scores from the spot. But then Liverpool’s Alisson Becker made two huge errors to gift Gundogan a second and Raheem Sterling City’s third, before Man of the Match Phil Foden rifled in a fourth late on. Liverpool slipped points behind Premier League leaders Manchester City. Liverpool looked to be getting back on track with 3-1 wins at Tottenham and West Ham but a shock defeat at home to Brighton — their second consecutive loss at Anfield after Burnley ended their 68-game unbeaten run — has left Jurgen Klopp’s side with a huge task. The Reds are ten points behind City, who have a game in hand, and in the aftermath of Wednesday’s 1-0 defeat to Brighton, full-back Andy Robertson went as far as saying Liverpool were no longer in the title race. — Skysports.
