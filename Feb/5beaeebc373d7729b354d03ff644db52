Government is working on modalities to bring a consignment of 75 000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines worth over US$1 million donated by India. Speaking at the Zimbabwe National Defence University, Indian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Vijay Khanduja confirmed that the vaccines would soon arrive in the country. Apart from the 75 000 Covid-19 vaccines pledged by India, Zimbabwe has the opportunity to buy more. Ambassador Khanduja said the relationship between the two countries would be strengthened despite the threat posed by the pandemic. He assured Zimbabweans that the vaccine was safe and was currently being used in India and other countries. “I understand there is some scepticism but trials have been conducted and proven. The vaccines have been used in India to put to rest all the scepticism about the Indian vaccine,” said Ambassador Khanduja.
