The Herald CAIRO. — Al Ahly president Mahmoud El-Khatib called head coach Pitso Mosimane, and his technical team, for a meeting after their CAF Champions League defeat to Simba SC. Mosimane tasted his first loss in the competition since his arrival which ended their 13-game unbeaten run dating back to 2019 when they lost to Tunisian Ligue 1 giants Etoile du Sahel. And ‘Bibo’ as the club president is affectionately known, who is widely considered as one of the greatest ever players, called in the South African and his technical team with the attendance of the club’s planning committee. The topic of discussion ranged from their current form after the FIFA Club World Cup and the upcoming gruelling period of fixtures with the league, Egypt Cup, Champions League and potentially the CAF Super Cup final on the horizon. One of the Red Devils directors confirmed to KickOff.com that it was far from an ‘intervention’ but rather a healthy discussion about how Mosimane can improve the team moving forward. This comes in the wake of Mosimane claiming he needs a new prolific striker after scoring only one goal at the Club World Cup. The record nine-time African champions host Al Gaish at their home ground Al-Salam Stadium tomorrow for their next league fixture before their Champions League encounter against AS Vita next Saturday. — KickOff.com
