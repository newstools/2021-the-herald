Being at home, lying idle as a visual artist is no excuse as you can owe it to lockdown for disturbing your business, rather finding creative ways to survive is being talented. Since lockdown started last year to curb the spread of coronavirus global pandemic, many artists have been crying that they have greatly affected their line of work. Some have opted to work from home while others are embracing the culture of virtual platforms. One talented graphic designer, digital cum visual artist Godknows Muchedzi who is working from home based in Hatfield said has opted to draw celebrity portraits in order to survive. Muchedzi who identifies any local celebrity or based in diaspora and sells his idea revealed in an interview that it was the only way to survive since there are a lot of visual artists. “I am popular on Instagram as @_navid_art. I have worked for local football superstars and celebrities like Tino Kadewere, Alec Mudimu, Tatenda Mukuruva, Freeman, Seh Calaz, prophet Passion Java, chief executive for Steward Bank Courage Mashavave and Lamont Chitepo among others. This is the only way I can survive for now and I am happy that it is paying,” he said. The 28-year-old visual artist said he puts his paintings on canvas depending on what the client wants. “I have been marketing my artworks on social media and I can say the lockdown to me has been a blessing rather than a curse because it has managed to give me the opportunity to shine and interact with country’s celebrities and fans at length,” he said. “I have always been a fan of digital art, so seeing popular artists on the internet inspired me. So far, I haven’t hosted any exhibition but I am looking forward to doing one. I sell my stuff on Instagram as soft and hard copies as well canvas,” he said. Muchedzi said he sold Tino Kadewere’s painting for USD500. Currently Zimdancehall musician Freeman is using Muchedzi’s artwork on his Gango album cover.
