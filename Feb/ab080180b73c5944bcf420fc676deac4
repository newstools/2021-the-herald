The Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission has today arrested Officer Commanding Matabeleland North Province Commissioner Erasmus Makodza over corruption related charges that were committed during his time when he was Officer Commanding Mashonaland East Province in 2019. Makodza who holds the rank of Commissioner has been charged under the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act for allegedly concealing from a principal a personal interest in a transaction. ZACC Spokesperson Commissioner John Makamure confirmed the arrest saying he is expected to appear in court tomorrow.
