The Herald MANCHESTER. — Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said it would be easy to feel overwhelmed by the packed fixture schedule but called on his players to embrace the “beautiful challenge” as they compete for four trophies. Guardiola also insisted that Manchester City are not thinking about the title even after they made top-flight history with victory over Everton on Wednesday night. Goals from Phil Foden, Riyad Mahrez and Bernardo Silva secured a 3-1 win at Goodison Park which means City are the first team to triumph in their opening 10 games of a calendar year. Guardiola’s side have now won 17 games on the spin in all competitions and this latest victory took them 10 points clear of Manchester United and Leicester at the top of the table. Only twice in English Premier League history has a team failed to win the title having built such an advantage. But Guardiola insisted: “I have not seen that the team is thinking of the table, we have spoken about that. We are not here to defend our lead, it is all about three points, three points.” “There are 42 points still to fight for, we are in the middle of February. Now we rest for a few days, there are so many games.” On the latest record to fall, Guardiola added: “It’s quite nice, it’s never been done before… but football is a sport that doesn’t wait, our next target is Arsenal. Of course today we will enjoy it, but tomorrow afternoon we will start to think about Arsenal.”— AFP
