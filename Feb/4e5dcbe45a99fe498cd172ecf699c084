THE Pakistan women’s cricket team is expected to arrive in Harare on Thursday for the series against Zimbabwe. The Asians are currently on tour of South Africa where they play their last match on Wednesday before boarding the plane the following day for Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe Cricket spokesperson Darlington Majonga said they are looking forward to the series which becomes the women’s first international assignment since May 2019. The series includes three one-dayers and two T20 Internationals. “As you’re probably well aware, we were given the greenlight by the government to host the Pakistan Women’s team for three one-dayers and two T20Is. “The Pakistan squad is scheduled to land at the Robert Mugabe International Airport at 1600 hours this Thursday, 4 February 2021,” said Majonga. The matches will be played in a bio-secure bubble due to the current coronavirus lockdown rules.
