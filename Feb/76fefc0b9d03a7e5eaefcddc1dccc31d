The Herald Senior Arts Reporter Today marks 22 years since the death of Funuel Nyasha Tazvida, affectionately known System Tazvida. The musician died on February 4, 1999 after suffering from an undisclosed illness. He hogged the limelight with his song “Mabhauwa” which was trendy, especially at shebeens, nightclubs and growth points, among other places were revellers would meet. Tazvida’s music was sang more in a satirical manner, but was very pregnant with meaning and was more of a social commentator on various issues that affect people in their day to day living. Some of his popular songs includes “Anodyiwa Haataure” and “Mushandi Ndimambo.” But it was his 1993 hit “Rudo Tsika Nemagariro” which pushed him to stardom. He had played with various bands, including the Khiama Boys, the Mabhauwa Express and the Sungura Boys before he formed Chazezesa Challengers. Chazezesa Challengers included Tazvida’s brothers Peter on bass and Isaac on backing vocals, with the other members being Lucky Mumiriki on rhythm who was a former member of Nyaminyami Sounds, Hurungwe Sounds and the Sungura Boys, Roggers Fatiya on drums and Fatiya’s young brother Last on the lead guitar. However, the band experienced two deaths in quick succession, as drummer Wezhira Shoko and talismanic leader Tazvida both died near the turn of the millennium. The group has continued without Tazvida and Wezhira, but is struggling and almost into oblivion. Since the death of Tazvida, the group has produced three albums, including the tribute record Panopfungaira Pane Moto in honour of their former leader. Tazvida’s successor and younger brother Peter died in 2002. The group continued under the leadership of Lee Roy Lunga and released their twelfth album, Smoko Pachena/Chabvondoka, in December 2002.
