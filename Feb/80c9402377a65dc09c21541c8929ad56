The Herald Thupeyo Muleya Beitbridge Bureau South Africa’s organised crime unit, the Hawks, has arrested four Zimbabwean border jumpers in Giyani, Limpopo province for illegal possession of a firearm. The quartet aged between 18 and 35 was picked up during a sting operation on Saturday while in possession of a 9mm Norinco pistol and travelling in two vehicles. Hawks’ spokesperson for Limpopo province, Captain Matimba Maluleke said the four men have since appeared before a Giyani Magistrate Court. “The four accused persons who were arrested over the weekend for possession of unlicensed firearm and contravening the Immigration Act appeared in the Giyani Magistrate’s Court today,” he said. “Daniel Dube (35) charged for possession of unlicensed firearm and contravening the Immigration Act was remanded in custody until February 17 for further investigation”. Capt Maluleke said another suspect, Jiros Dube (29) charged for contravening the Immigration Act was also remanded in custody until February 12 to allow the state to look for a Shona interpreter. Others, Simon Dube (18) and Enoch Dube (25) were fined 1 000 rand and 1 500 rand respectively or alternatively six months imprisonment. The official said the suspects were arrested following a tip off. “Upon searching the vehicles, one firearm, a 9mm Norinco pistol with its serial number filed off and ammunition were found and seized,” said Capt Maluleke. “During the preliminary investigation, it was established that the four suspects are undocumented foreign nationals.”
