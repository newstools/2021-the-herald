RACING returns to Borrowdale Park and Racecourse in Harare tomorrow afternoon when they host the first leg of the Zimbabwe Silver Tiara the Fillies Classic. A total of seven runners are expected to take to the starting stalls in the future race the Fillies Classic over 1600metres. Stablemates Dindingwe and True Beauty are due to clash again in the race, but this time they will have to worry about Mazikeen from the Gokhan Terzi stable, Borrowdale newcomer Karoo Winter, and Obscure who all stand a chance. Obscure is sister to South Africa-based Lily Blue who won the Silver Tiara in 2020, and for all sorts of sentimental reasons many will be wishing her well.All the runners are set to carry 58 kg â€“ but Dindingwe and Karoo Winter will have claiming apprentices in the irons. Dindingwe by Futura out of a Jallad (USA) mare is from the Kirk Swanson yard and will have apprentice Rodgers Satombo on the irons. Dindingwe is the winner of three of her four starts, including the Champion Juvenile Stakes and the Breeders Fillies Mile. Her stable companion True Beauty looks her main threat but in the Fillies Mile she got the better of True Beauty by 2.50 lengths when Satombo was still claiming four kilogrammes.
