Government has intervened to accelerate ongoing harvesting of winter maize in the Lowveld by deploying a specialised combine- harvester and an automated bagging machine to speed up delivery of harvested grain to the Grain Marketing Board (GMB). The winter maize harvesting is way behind scheduled after falling prey to a prolonged wet spell which forced harvesting to be done manually as the fields were muddy and wet. This year the winter maize initiative jointly done by Tongaat Huletts Zimbabwe, Masvingo Development Trust and Government had an over tenfold increase in hectarage from a measly 327ha last year. This created unprecedented logistical challenges, a situation worsened by incessant rains.
Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Resettlement Minister Dr Anxious Jongwe Masuka today said that Government has intervened to speed up harvesting of the crop. Speaking after touring the winter maize project at Hippo Valley estates and Triangle to assess challenges obtaining in the ongoing harvesting, Dr Masuka said all the maize is expected to have been mopped within the next two and half weeks.
