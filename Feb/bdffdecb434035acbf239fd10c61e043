BOXER Tinashe “Chairman” Mwadziwana is confident he will stand his own when he trades leather with Namibia’s Nathanael Kakololo for the African Boxing Union featherweight title. The Zimbabwean boxer is challenging for the title and is already in Namibia for the fight due to take place on February 27 in Windhoek.
He left for Namibia on Wednesday accompanied by his trainer Clyde Musonda. Speaking before his departure, Mwadziwana said after spending some time in Chivhu training, he is hopeful of overcoming his opponent. “I am now ready because I think our preparation was good. We did all we could although we did not have access to some of the equipment that we needed because gyms are closed. But we just improvised on what we had. “I believe I have reached the fitness level needed, so I can say so far so good and I am looking forward to a win,” Mwadziwana said.
The national super bantamweight champion weight said he is aware of the challenge ahead but says the good boxer on the day will walk away with the belt. “We have a game plan based on what we have seen, how he fights and I am aware of his record. Of course, I am coming from a long break and he has been active but I had a lot of sparring. “So we are two good boxers meeting and the better boxer on the day will get the belt,” Mwadziwana said.
