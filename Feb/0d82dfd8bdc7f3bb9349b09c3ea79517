ROY Mwadzura and Linda Shaba were crowned the men’s and women’s champions of the Piraishe Mabhena Chess Memorial Tournament after they saw off stiff challenges from local and foreign-based players at the weekend. The Zimbabwe Chess Federation successfully held an online tournament in honour of its late regional chairman for Masvingo, Mabhena, who passed on January 1 after some post-operation complications. Mabhena, a veteran administrator who was also into football administration, had transformed Masvingo Province Chess Association into one of the best-run provinces in the country. The online chess tournament was the first of its kind in this country and it was held online due to Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. The local chess fraternity was denied a chance to bid farewell to their chairman, Mabhena, due to Covid-19 restrictions on travel and gatherings so they saw it fit to commemorate him through a tournament. Mwadzura was crowned the men’s champion after amassing an impressive 85 points as Cyril Chigodo took second place with a distant 74 points. Tawanda Zambuko managed to scoop third place with 67 points whilst Lloyd Moyo and Tasiso Chikandi came fourth and fifth respectively.
In the women’s category, top female online player, Shaba, did not disappoint as she won a gold medal as national team players Christine Makwena and Colletah  Wakuruwarewa took second and third places respectively.
Terrence Mureya was the best placed junior player, after he finished on position 16, winning the best Under-18 award.
