THERE have been amazing individual success stories for women in Zimbabwean sport. Tennis legend, Cara Black, a five-time Grand Slam doubles winner, and swimming icon, Kirsty Coventry, lead the way. Others, like Connie Sibanda, the Commonwealth blind bowling sensation, US college tennis star, Fadzai Masiyazi, and motocross rider, Tanya Muzinda, have also excelled on grand platforms. In team sports, however, that success had been missing. But, now, things appear to be changing. Some team sports are now producing stars finding their way to the top in Europe. Gems skipper, Felistus Kwangwa, signed a professional netball contract with Vitality Super League side Surrey Storm and made her debut, at the weekend, in the United Kingdom. Zimbabwe’s netball team’s historic appearance, at the World Cup in Liverpool, paid off after the goal defender was spotted during the tournament. Mighty Warriors skipper, Emmaculate Msipa, signed a one-year contract with Spanish Segunda Division Pro side. She played in her debut match on Sunday, three days after her arrival. Msipa follows in the footsteps of fellow Mighty Warriors star, Rutendo “Madzimai” Makore, who played for Sporting de Huelva, two years ago. Yesterday, veteran sports administrator, Titus Zvomuya, said he hopes the structures and systems will continue to be professional and nurture the abundant talent in different sport codes. “Netball Gems captain, Felistus Kwangwa, and Mighty Warriors skipper, Emmaculate Msipa, have proven beyond doubt that the Girl Child has a lot of potential, in flying the national flag high, when they made their entry into professional sport in Europe,’’ said Zvomuya. “I was Emmaculate Msipa’s CdM (chef de mission) at the 2016 Rio Olympics and her leadership qualities and skill on the field of play were exemplary and beyond the ordinary. “Her immaculate goal in Sao Paulo was a gem of a goal. It has been captured in the annals of Olympic history. “These two players have made all of us in Zimbabwe sport proud. It is my sincere hope that our structures, and systems, will continue to be professional, solid, and sound so that we continue to produce and nurture such talent. “It’s not that easy for a Girl Child to make it into UK sport, if one is from a team sport. But these two have proved all of us wrong. “All I can say is well done girls. Remember you are now our true ambassadors of sport. “Sport is known for producing the most remarkable athletes, colourful characters, influential leaders, and memorable heroes, these two individuals will leave a significant legacy.’’ Zvomuya encouraged the duo to be professional. “These two have now joined the world of elite and professional, athletes so I encourage them to exhibit admirable characteristics that will help them to succeed further in their chosen careers,’’ he said. “They need to take advantage of the unique experiences and newly-found opportunities. “These traits include motivation, self-discipline, focus, resiliency, humility, patriotism, passion, among many others.’’ Yesterday, Msipa said she knows many people were looking up to her and she will make the most of her chance. <img class="size-full wp-image-530722" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/Untitled-4-12.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/Untitled-4-12.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/Untitled-4-12-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Emmaculate Msipa The former Black Rhinos Queens says language is proving to be a huge barrier. Unlike Kwangwa, who doesn’t have such a problem in the United Kingdom, Msipa says she has to learn quickly the local language. “Communication is a major challenge, they don’t even speak English and, so, at training, I end up emulating others, what others are doing using my football brain. “I am trying to learn their language. “They are good people but, without understanding their language, life appears very difficult. “But, I have to adjust because l know that is football life, if I want to make my nation proud, my family and everyone back home, I have to focus. “I don’t want to end my career here, my ambition is even to sign for bigger teams, so I have to make it work,” she said. Msipa believes she will become one of the first-choice players in the CF Joventut team. “The coach said we need goals, we need you to shoot, even the owner of the club told me that I should help them win matches,’’ she said. “From my assessment, they believe in me and, basing from Monday training, it seems I am now in the first 11, the one who was playing in my position, has been relegated to the second team.’’
