The Herald Behind every successful celebrity is a spouse and that spouse is more often than not very quiet, but powerful behind the scenes. And more often than not, the characters behind the scenes do not see the celebrity aspect, but sees a family member, a father, mother, sister, brother or parent. Those who put them on a leash do not see them as celebrities. It is also true that being a spouse of a celebrity snatches away the comfort of a ‘private’ life and thrusts one under the limelight. In most cases, it has an effect on their social behaviour. Saturday Herald Lifestyle caught up with some of the spouses of local celebrities from business, sport to music to found out how they adapt to their partners’ celebrity status. Some spouses were not a liberty to speak and their privacy has to be respected. Who remembers the popular television reality show WAGS — an American reality documentary television series that ran for three seasons on the E! television network, a show chronicling both the professional and personal lives of several celebrities. WAGs is an acronym for Wives and Girlfriends of Sportspersons. Zimbabwean international football star Tino Kadewere, who plays for French Ligue 1 side Lyon, met his wife Sharon in 2012. <img class="size-full wp-image-531337" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/1902-1-1-UNNAMED-36.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/1902-1-1-UNNAMED-36.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/1902-1-1-UNNAMED-36-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sharon and Tino Kadewere Sharon described her husband as a cheerful man and said she was not intimidated by his fame because it comes with the package. “I met Tino in December 2012 in Highfield,” she said. “He used to greet me whenever I passed by since we were staying in the same hood. So, his parents were having their 25th wedding anniversary and they wanted one girl to complete the bridal team. They invited me over to their home to ask if I was comfortable to be on the bridal team. I said yes, and of course it was now an opportunity for Tino, since he liked me way before.” Sharon said she didn’t give him a chance at first. “Soon after, I became his dancing partner on the bridal team and that’s how we then fell in love. We all know the pressure that comes with being a celebrity, but I can’t say I’m affected because he knows his priorities and what’s more important to him. Sharon said Tino tells her everything he will be involved in. “What I like about him is he never does anything without speaking to me first,” she said. “He never hides anything from me and I’m behind most of the things, which is a good thing. ” Sharon said she never thought that one day she will be married to a celebrity. “No, it wasn’t my wish because when I met him I never knew about his career since we were both still in school,” she said. “I didn’t even know much about football either, I wasn’t into it until he made me understand it.” Sharon said the best gift she had received from Tino was love and respect. For Rutendo Chidavaenzi, who is married to award winning and prominent music producer MacDonald Chidavaenzi affectionately known as Mcdee, she also never thought she would  get married to a celebrity. <img class="size-full wp-image-531340" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/1902-1-1-UNNAMED-27.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/1902-1-1-UNNAMED-27.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/1902-1-1-UNNAMED-27-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> McDee and Rutendo They met in 2015 after Mcdee sent a message wishing her a happy birthday. “He sent me a direct message on my birthday and the way he was so respectful made me respond,” said Rutendo. “I do not tolerate random messages in my social media accounts. He later came to see me and from then we were on and off until we got married in 2017 and it has been an exciting journey.” Rutendo said she understands what comes with fame and trust has made their relationship strong. “I appreciate his work and respect his fans,” she said. “Trust conquers all. It is not practical to micro manage your spouse, especially when his life is surrounded by fans, girls, so trust can only be the best thing for us as a family. He is very charming, loving and caring. He has helped me start my own business.” Rutendo is the first fan and music listener on her husband’s projects. “I am the first person to listen to his projects before they are released,” she said. “My husband is not a “mbinga”, but we are happy with what we have. The best gift I have received was my daughter and a car.” Sherlynn Sadomba, who is married to former Zimbabwe international footballer and businessman Edward Sadomba, said she is somehow affected by his celebrity status because they are always in the public eye. “I met him in 2001 when I visited my grandmother in Mbare,” she said. “We dated from that time till we got married in 2008. I am absolutely affected by his fame in a good way because he is a people-person and he commands a lot of respect from his supporters and the general community, which consequently comes as a good thing for me. “In a negative way, our lives are open just like the sky, we are mostly in the public eye. It’s not a good place to be all the time.” Sherlynn said she has been trying to balance Edward’s lifestyle. “When you have been with a person for so long you will eventually get the hang of it,” she said. “I am also a fan of other celebrities and I know the feeling of wanting to share an experience with an icon, so I see it as part of who he is. “He makes my life easier by not compromising when it comes to his family, he balances it so well it has never been a problem.” Sherlynn said her husband was a determined and hard working man. “I am his overall manager,” she said. “Funny enough, I used to ask my husband whilst we were still dating how being a footballer would be called a career. I had no interest in soccer, I didn’t understand the game, let alone the fame that came with it since we started dating way before stardom. “For me, it was a coincidence dating a superstar in the making.” <img class="size-full wp-image-531341" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/1902-1-1-UNNAMED-28.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/1902-1-1-UNNAMED-28.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/1902-1-1-UNNAMED-28-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Stunner and Dyonne Hair model Dyonne met hip-hop rapper Stunner (Desmond Chideme) in 2015 at a sports club. “I was trying to buy drinks for my sisters and the bar was overcrowded and he offered to help,” she said. “He did this in exchange for my number and I gave him a fake one. I didn’t know who he was, only for me to bump into him at a different place that same night. “We spent most of the night outside, talking and we clicked.” Dyonne said she was not affected by Stunner’s fame. “We have been together for long and I am able to differentiate between Stunner and Desmond,” she said. “He loves his children and my job is to make sure he is fresh and clean.” Valentine Magwaza is married to businessman Carl of the Carling Meats, which has been trending on social media. It must have been hard for Valentine as Carl, who is always on social media marketing his products, meets a lot of people, and gets a lot of direct messages. <img class="size-full wp-image-531343" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/1902-1-1-UNNAMED-45.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/1902-1-1-UNNAMED-45.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/1902-1-1-UNNAMED-45-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Valentine and Carl Magwaza “We met in April 2016 through a mutual friend,” she said. “The initial plan was I would come to Harare to drop off my curriculum vitae and go back home to Triangle. I met Carl and I was originally supposed to stay for only two weeks, but it became a year and half and we got married. “I am not intimidated by his fame because he always balances between business and family. I appreciate that we are different, and I respect his space, and I am grateful that I am the first person to hear about his great ideas.” Valentine said she was scared in the early days, but later got to understand Carl. “I love his perspective about life, about situations, he always brings out a different way of thinking,” she said. “I am involved in the whole process, we work together. I have learnt that we can do more when we are in agreement.” Valentine said the best gift she has received from Carl was their child Xae Amaya. Comedianne Tyra Chikocho (Madam Boss) has been a subject of great controversy in her line of trade, with many labelling her husband Ngoni Munetsiwa a.k.a Mhofu as being ‘too soft’. She once posted that the negative comments were affecting their marriage, but later on the two developed thick skin. Madam Boss said it was love that made them have a strong relationship. Mhofu, who also doubles up as his wife’s manager, no longer cares about what people say concerning their relationship and fully supports his wife’s business and career.
