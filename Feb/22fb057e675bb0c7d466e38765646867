The Herald Sports Reporter THE eagerly-awaited cricket series between the Zimbabwe women’s national team and their Pakistan counterparts is taking shape as the tourists arrived on Thursday evening on their first-ever international tour to the country.  The two teams are expected to face off in three 50-over matches and as many T20Is at the Harare Sports Club as part of their preparations for the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup Qualifiers to be held later in the year. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-528646" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-05-at-12.54.42.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-05-at-12.54.42.jpeg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-05-at-12.54.42-360x200.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The two teams were scheduled to play five matches, but the addition of another T20I will serve as an opportunity for them to feature in another competitive match. Zimbabwe are excited about the tour as they have last played international cricket almost two years ago. The hosts have assembled a squad that is currently in camp in Harare. The players have been split into two teams –  Northern and Southern – from where the selectors are expected to pick the final squad after a couple of practice games. Pakistan arrived in the country after completing a tour of South Africa where they lost the ODI series 3-0 and the T20I series 2-1. However, it must be noted that the tourists gave South Africa a run for their money as almost every match went down to the wire.
