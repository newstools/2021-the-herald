ZIMBABWE took their medal tally to three, yesterday, after sprinter Pamela Vimbai Shumba won bronze at the 12th Fazza International Athletics competition underway in Dubai. The World Para Athletics serve as qualification for the Tokyo Games. Shumba settled for bronze, after she came third, in the women’s 100m. Zimbabwean athletes, Margaret Bangajena and Albert Sigele, opened the account after they picked up the first two bronze medals on Wednesday and Thursday. The 43-year-old Bangajena came third in the 800m wheelchair category. The 23-year-old Sigele came third, in the 1 500 men’s T20, breaking the African record, in the process. He stopped the clock at 4:09.44m, coming home behind the Russian pair of Alexander Rabotnitskiy and Pavel Sarkeev, who got gold and silver, in impressive times of 3:55.87m and 4:02.33m. Last night, Sigele and Clemence Nyoni were due to participate in the long jump. Chief de Mission, Ignatius Vambe, is optimistic some of their athletes will post Tokyo Games qualification times. “Albert should have made it, we just need final confirmation, at the end of the competition the organisers will submit a confirmed list of all athletes who will have made it for Tokyo,” he said. The Games end tomorrow.
