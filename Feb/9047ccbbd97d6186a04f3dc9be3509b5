MASHONALAND Turf Club were given the green light to hold their races in line with Covid-19 regulations and will today hold their second race meeting for the year 2021. The racing association successfully applied for the right to hold the future races which are monitored internationally and would have had a negative impact on the sport if they remained idle. The Sports Commission, who regulate the holding of competitions, confirmed that they have given the local racing motherbody the go-ahead to hold their races until the end of season in April. Several other sports associations, including the Zimbabwe Aquatic Union, Zimbabwe Golf Association, ZIFA for FC Platinum and the senior national men’s soccer team, have successfully presented their cases and got the green-light to resume competitions. There were mixed feelings that the racing fraternity was defying Government orders on Covid-19 restrictions but it has come to light that the association successfully applied for the right to host some events which are virtually monitored globally. Today’s race will have the Fillies Classic as the future race on a card that will have eight races.
