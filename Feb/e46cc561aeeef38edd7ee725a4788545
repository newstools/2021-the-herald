I am 15 years old. I love to read and write, but mostly I love writing. I have been writing since I was in Grade Four. I had lost my Dad and decided to put my emotions on paper. Since then, I have been working on a book titled, “It All Started When Her Father Passed Away”. This was the first book I wrote. I wrote it mostly to help other children who lost their parents or loved ones. The book is now being edited. After joining the Writers’ Club at school and being motivated, my two friends and I started writing a book, which was launched in December 2020 at Hope Community Church. It is called “The Road to Success”. We wrote the book in order to inspire young people like us to stay focused and not lose their way. We did not only end on the book. My friend, Hazel, and I are in the process of starting a foundation, HALNA, because we want to help disadvantaged girls and also motivate other girls. I have been reading many books written by great women like Michelle Obama, the former First Lady of the USA.
