The Herald MADRID. — Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman will hope Wednesday’s Copa del Rey comeback can inspire his team to close the gap in the Spanish La Liga football table as they take on Real Betis tomorrow. Barca scored twice in the last four minutes against Granada to come from two goals down and force extra-time before winning 5-3 to reach the cup semi-finals. But, they have work to do in La Liga, sitting level on points with Real Madrid but 10 behind Atletico, who also have a game in hand over their two chasing rivals. Koeman admitted last weekend Barcelona have to be “realistic” about their chances of lifting trophies this season and that the current squad “aren’t ready to win many things”. Yet he was more upbeat after his side’s rousing display in midweek. “These games and these results can help the spirit and strength of a team,” said Koeman. “We have fought in adversity and that’s what we have to do. These kinds of moments can be very important for this season.” Spanish La Liga Fixtures Today: Levante v Granada (3pm), Huesca v Real Madrid (5:15pm), Elche v Villarreal (7:30om), Sevilla v Getafe (10pm) Tomorrow: Real Sociedad v Cadiz (3pm), Athletic Bilbao v Valencia (5:15pm), Osasuna v Eibar (7:30pm), Real Betis v Barcelona (10pm) Monday: Atletico Madrid v Celta Vigo (10pm). — AFP.
