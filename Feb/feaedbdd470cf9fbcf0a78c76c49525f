The Herald Tendai Rupapa Senior Reporter A judicial manager of a mining company allegedly sold the exclusive mining rights of that company three times between October and December last year causing one company to lose US$260 000. Cecil Madondo, the managing director of Tudor House Consultants (Pvt) Ltd, had been appointed by the High Court as corporate rescue practitioner of Redwing Mine in Penhalonga, Mutare when he allegedly sold the mining rights three times. He was not asked to plead to the charges when he appeared before Harare magistrate Mr Ngoni Nduna who remanded him in custody to today for continuation of bail application. He is being represented by Mr Reuben Mukavhi. On October 15 last year, Madondo told Patricia Mutombgwera and Grant Chitate that he had given their company Probadeck Investments Pvt Ltd exclusive mining rights in respect of claims held by Redwing Mining Company Pvt Ltd covering 132 gold mining blocks, eight copper mining blocks and any other mining claims belonging to Redwing Mine. On October 30 last year, it is alleged, Mutombgwera and Chitate acting upon that information signed a joint venture relationship agreement with the mining company represented by Madondo believing that their company had secured exclusive mining rights. Both parties went on to register a tribute agreement with the registrar of deeds to operationalise their joint venture agreement. Probabadek Investments allegedly paid US$60 000 corporate rescue fees into Madondo’s personal company, Tudor House Consultants, and made a capital expenditure amounting to US$200 000. It is alleged that sometime in November 2020 Madondo well knowing that he had ceded all mining rights to Probadek Investments, prepared another memorandum of tribute agreement with Prime Royal Pvt Ltd giving them the same mining blocks which he had ceded to Probadek. On December 1, Madondo, the court heard, entered into another memorandum of tribute agreement with Betterbrands Mining Pvt Ltd giving them the same mining blocks. During the same month, Betterbrands and Prime Royal assumed control of Redwing mine and started carrying out mining activities which Probadek was entitled to. According to the State, as result of Madondo’s actions, Probadeck lost US$260 000. Mrs Tinashe Makiya and Mrs Netsai Mushayabasa prosecuted.
