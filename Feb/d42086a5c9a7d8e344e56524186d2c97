Chegutu Rural District Council acting chief executive officer, Mr Admire Machingura confirmed the bursts. “The dams are used to support irrigation purposes, for livestock, human consumption and mining activities. “At least 200 households and a number of small scale miners have so far been affected. “We are hearing reports that the bursts have also resulted in the destruction of crops and death of livestock,” he said. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-528472" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-04-at-14.14.01.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-04-at-14.14.01.jpeg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/WhatsApp-Image-2021-02-04-at-14.14.01-360x200.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> One Farnam villager, Mr Reason Chigogo said at least five goats from his village were swept away. “Most farmers who have their fields close to the dams lost their crops when the dams burst their walls and for now, it is still early to give the number of hectares affected and that of animals killed although five goats from Farnam were swept away,” Mr Chigogo said. Mr Machingura said while efforts were being put in place to address the challenge, the council had also acquired a transformer to help draw water from Mupfure River to Clifford Dam which also burst its walls recently. The dam is used to support some suburbs under the council.
