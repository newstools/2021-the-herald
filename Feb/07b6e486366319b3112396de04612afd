The Herald The Mozambique Ports and Railway Company (CFM) yesterday started to replace tracks on the railway line connecting the port city of Beira to Machipanda, on the border with landlocked Zimbabwe, as part of a US$200 million investment. Speaking in Dondo district, in the central province of Sofala, where the launch ceremony was held, CFM board chairperson Miguel Matabel  pledged that the railroad rehabilitation, which began last year, would  be completed in 2022. “We would like to entreat everyone to look at the project as a common  benefit to all Mozambicans and avoid theft of railway equipment, because  such a stance jeopardises its development,” he said. Matabel said unlike the old tracks which could bear up to 40 kilograms  per metre, the new ones could take up to 45 kilograms, thus boosting  production and productivity. The work underway consists of welding the ends of seven 18 metre tracks  to form a single track that is 126 metres long, thus forming a more robust line, in line with international standards, allowing it to carry  heavier cargo trains. “We were using 60 tonne wagons, but from now on will use 80 tonne wagons”,  said Matabel, describing the work as crucial to improving the capacity  of the line.
