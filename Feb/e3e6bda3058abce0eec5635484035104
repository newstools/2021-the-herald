The Herald LONDON.  — Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho was in typical bullish mood after yet another defeat — claiming that he is still the best football manager in the world. Goals from Michail Antonio and Jesse Lingard helped West Ham to a 2-1 win against their London rivals on Sunday. Lucas Moura’s header proved only a consolation, with the result seeing West Ham climb to fourth spot in the English Premier League. Spurs, meanwhile are down in ninth and nine points behind the Hammers in that final Champions League spot. But Mourinho batted away criticism speaking after the game — despite having the lowest points total from 50 games in his entire managerial career. Asked whether results have made him doubt his methods, the 58-year-old told Sky Sports: “No, not at all. Not at all. Zero. Sometimes results are a consequence of multiple situations in football. “Mine, and my coaching staff’s methods, are second to nobody in the world.” Earlier this season Spurs were sitting pretty at the top of the English Premier League and there was plenty of talk that their hunt for a trophy would finally end. But now they face a battle to even bag a European spot, although they are in the League Cup final and still in the Europa League. He was asked whether the Londoners were “in crisis”, to which he responded: “I don’t know what you mean by crisis. “If crisis is frustration and sadness in the dressing room, I would say so, because nobody is happy, we all showed that in this game. “When a team fights the way we did until the last second trying to get a different result, it is never a group in crisis. “Groups are in crisis when you are not together in the search for better results than you have. So I wouldn’t say crisis, I would say a really bad run of results. That is obvious. We are losing too many matches.” Next up for Spurs is the second leg of their Europa League clash against Wolfsburg on Thursday, holding a 4-1 lead. — The Sun.
