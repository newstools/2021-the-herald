The Herald Bulawayo Bureau FIRE broke out at Hwange Power Station Unit One and it took 40 minutes to put it out. Zesa Holdings was by last night yet to ascertain the damage caused by the fire and the impact to the power supplies. Energy and Power Development Minister Zhemu Soda said the fire broke out between 5pm and 6pm. He said Zesa executive chairman Dr Sydney Gata informed him about the incident which forced the power utility to effect temporary load shedding last night. “I received the report from Dr Gata. He called me to indicate that there was a fire incident at the power station and that they are yet to ascertain the level of damage. “The fire broke out on unit One and it took about 40 minutes to put it out. Accordingly, there is a likelihood of some temporary load shedding tonight,” he said. Minister Soda said the Zimbabwe Power Company was yet to conduct an assessment on the damage and impact of the fire to power supplies.
