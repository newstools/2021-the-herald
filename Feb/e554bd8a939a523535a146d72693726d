SPAIN-BASED Zimbabwean goalkeeper Martin Mapisa recorded a third clean sheet in four games after he was involved in Zamora CF’s 1-0 win over Pontevedra in the Segunda Division B at the weekend. The 22-year-old Aces Youth Soccer Academy graduate, who appears to have taken over the gloves from veteran Jon Villanueva, delivered a fine show after he was thrown into the starting line-up again by manager David Movilla. Mapisa has largely been understudy to the Spanish goalkeeper since he arrived at the third-tier club last year. But he has made the most of the opportunity ever since he was given the nod to start in the recent Copa Del Rey matches. He has now played four league matches on the bounce. In his first Segunda Division B match, Mapisa kept clean sheet in the 1-0 win over former La Liga side, Deportivo la Coruna. He then featured in the 2-0 win over Coruxo and the 1-1 against Racing Ferrol. The 1-0 win over Pontevedra at the weekend shows the growing confidence that the team’s head coach, Movilla, has in the young Zimbabwean goalkeeper. Zamora are pushing hard for promotion into the second tier of Spanish football. They are currently second in the race for promotion. Their away win at Pontevedra powered them closer to log leaders Unionistas CF. Zamora are now on 22 points from 12 starts while Unionistas CF have 25 points and have played one game more.
