The Herald Ricky Zililo in BULAWAYO PRESIDENT Mnangagwa took time, off his busy schedule, to host Bulawayo giants Highlanders at State House, promising to assist the club with their mining venture. The President, who arrived in the City of Kings on Tuesday evening ahead of the Gwayi-Shangani pipeline ground-breaking ceremony, as well as the commissioning of the Epping Forest boreholes in Nyamandlovu, met the Bosso leadership, led by board chairman Luke Mnkandla. Executive chairman Kenneth Mhlophe, treasurer Donald Ndebele and chief executive Nhlanhla Dube were also in attendance. The Bosso head of secretariat, Dube, said they briefed the President about the progress they have made, in relation to the mining claim that was given to the club, to ease their financial woes. “It was a great pleasure to meet the President, who took a break from his busy schedule to meet Highlanders FC,’’ said Dube. “We were there to present to him, the progress we’ve made in relation to the mine, he listened to the challenges that we’re facing and promised to assist us in the venture. “He took with him our proposal and, to me, he showed kindheartedness, as he listened to us.” The Government, through the Ministry of Mines and Mining Development, approved relevant paperwork for Bosso to start operations at their gold mining claim in Inyathi, Bubi District, last December. The club have been hunting for potential partners. The meeting with the President gives hope to the club’s intended commercial venture. The Highlanders leadership also presented a Number-9 jersey, to the President, as well as another framed club replica, in appreciation for the Government’s decision to give them a mine. The mining venture comes at a time when Highlanders celebrates 95 years of existence and becomes a perfect present from the Head of State and Government. President Mnangagwa also once assisted the club by getting their bus cleared at Zimra.
