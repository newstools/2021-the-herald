Former Cabinet minister Ignatius Chombo was today granted bail by Harare regional magistrate Mr Stanford Mambanje and was ordered to continue following bail conditions imposed on his other previous corruption related charges. Mr Mambanje said Chombo will be required to report once a fortnight to police and surrender title deeds to his Marlborough property.
Chombo is charged with fraud and five counts of criminal abuse of office during his time in Government. In his ruling, Mr Mambanje said Chombo has proved that he will not abscond trial as he has travelled to South Africa nine times and returned.
