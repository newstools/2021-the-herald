The Herald LONDON. — Joseph Parker wants to knock out Zimbabwe-born British heavyweight boxer Derek Chisora in England before defeating the winner of Oleksandr Usyk vs Joe Joyce. He is plotting his return to the top of the world. The former WBO champion (28), lost his title to Anthony Joshua, in March 2018. Now he has outlined his plans for an exciting 2021 and an attempt to climb back to the upper echelons of the heavyweight division — although the New Zealander’s first task is to get past Junior Fa in Auckland today. A victory would set-up a rescheduled clash against Chisora after their original 2019 clash was cancelled when Parker suffered a spider bite. Usyk and Joyce are already in talks about a WBO interim title fight. And Parker says he is being lined up to face the winner of that, telling Sky Sports: “I’m open to fighting anyone, but with the talks from my promoter, Eddie Hearn and Matchroom and with [manager] David Higgins, they’ve got a clear pathway for me this year. “Take care of Junior, then fighting Chisora, then fighting the winner of Usyk and Joyce. “There is a path and it’s quite exciting that there’s a path, because a lot of fighters want to know what they’re going to do after their next fight. But again, the focus is on Junior because if I don’t get past him, there’s no point even looking at those fights.” Parker has only lost two of his 29 career fights, with both of these setbacks coming on British soil courtesy of AJ and Dillian Whyte. However, he is relishing the prospect of potentially heading back to England this summer to face Chisora once crowds are allowed back. Parker added: “I love the UK. I love the media, the respect, so welcoming to our team. We’ve gained a lot of friends and supporters there. “In a perfect world, I’d love to take care of business on Saturday then come to the UK and take care of business, then not far off that, fight for the world title.” — The Sun
