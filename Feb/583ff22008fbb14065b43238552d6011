The Herald Sifelani Tsiko Agric, Environment & innovations Editor Zimbabwe’s largest seed company Seed Co is hosting a virtual sugar bean production symposium to enhance productivity, sustainability and boost the country’s food security position. “Seed Co is hosting the Sugarbean Seed Production Virtual Symposium today,” the company said. “Seed Co is partnering NGOs and Donors to create profitable businesses that will definitely benefit and sustain farmers. “Our agenda is to find ways to work with these institutions to create sustainability and food security in Zimbabwe by knowledge sharing and showcasing our products.” A number of speakers from the country’s agricultural sector including other key sectors are expected to make presentations on various aspects of sugar bean growing. The symposium was coming at a time when the group was directing capital expenditure directed towards undertaking an artificial seed dryer project. Its completion has been delayed by a combination of foreign currency shortages, liquidity challenges and COVID-19 restrictions. The company last year revealed plans to set up a US$10 million seed drying facility to reduce post-harvest losses and enable farmers to utilise land at least twice a year. The company has also developed a number of sugar bean varieties. Seed Co International Limited has operations in Nigeria, Zambia, Rwanda, Malawi, Kenya and Tanzania.
