The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE youth international, Tapiwa Mandinyenya, is likely to become another gem from the Aces Youth Academy to leave the country without having played in the domestic top-flight league. He is set to sign with South African National First Division side, JRD Stars, in the next few days. The 18-year-old featured for the Young Warriors at the 2018 Cosafa Under-17 Championships. AYSA director, Nigel Munyati, whose other product Blessing Sarupinda is moving to Europe this week, confirmed that Mandinyenya will be on the move. “We are happy that our player, Mandinyenya, will be moving to South Africa where he will join JDR Stars, which plays in the National First Division,’’ said Munyati. ‘’Mandinyenya was scouted while paying for the Under-17 national team and we are happy that he has managed to get a contract. “The youngster is great, playing as a wall with his back to the goal, as he can shield and hold the ball well. His shooting is also good and accurate.’’ AYSA are known for producing top players with several national team players, like Knowledge Musona, Khama Billiat, Martin Mapisa, George Chigova and Donovan Benard, having passed through the academy. “We are not sorely into football as we also take into consideration academics,’’ said Munyati. “What drives us is the vision and, for over a decade, we have managed to remain within our set standards to add value to players with potential, both in the field of play, and academically.”
