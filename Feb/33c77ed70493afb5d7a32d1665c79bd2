One of the major beneficiaries of the borehole is Bere Clinic. Masvingo West National Assembly member and Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Ezra Chadzamira spearheaded the drilling of the borehole. Councillor for the area Cde Aleta Makomeke paid tribute to Minister Chadzamira’s office and the council for easing water woes in the town. “We are back from the brink, though the water (from new borehole) is still not enough for the mining town’s entire population, but at least the clinic now has water,” she said.
