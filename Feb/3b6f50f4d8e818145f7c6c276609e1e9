The Herald LOS ANGELES. — With the Masters just six-plus weeks away, Tiger Woods said on Sunday that he isn’t certain he will be ready to play in the event, the year’s first major golf championship. Woods made his first public comments since undergoing his fifth back surgery, with the 15-time major champion uncertain if he will be able to play at the Masters. Asked if he plans to play in April at the Masters, which he won in 2019, Woods said, “God, I hope so.” Woods, who underwent a fifth back surgery on December 23, said in a CBS interview during the Genesis Invitational that he could not commit to playing a tournament before the Masters and that even the event itself, from April 8 to 11, remains uncertain. He originally expected to take 10 to 12 weeks for recovery, which would have him back by mid-March. Asked specifically about the Masters, he offered “God, I hope so. But I’ve got to get there first. I don’t have much wiggle room left. I’ve got only one back.” But the 45-year-old winner of 82 PGA Tour titles, level with Sam Snead for the all-time record, said it will depend on how well he recovers. — AFP.
