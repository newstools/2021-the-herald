WARRIORS forward David Moyo could find himself playing in the Scottish Championship next season if he finds no new offers after his club Hamilton Academical was effectively relegated from the top-flight following a 1-2 defeat at Ross County yesterday. While Hamiltonâ€™s relegation from the Scottish Premiership has not been mathematically confirmed, the club will have to beat second-from-bottom Kilmarnock by at least nine goals on Sunday. The Accies are on 30 points, three behind Kilmernock who themselves need all the points to stand a chance of avoiding play-offs. Hamilton needs to summon the energy they once showed in beating Morton 10-2 in 2014 but Moyo has admitted that on paper the team should start preparing for life in the Scottish second-tier next season.
