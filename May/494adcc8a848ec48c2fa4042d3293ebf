The Herald Sports Reporter BORROWDALE Park and race course will host the third leg of Triple Crown, the Zimbabwe Derby. The race, meant for three-year-olds, will have a small field of four runners who were accepted, as of yesterday. Kirk Swanson yard have three runners in Diesel And Dust, Magnus Maximus and Rocquette while Bridget Stidolph will saddle Only Him. Dieseland Dust is the favourite and his connections will be hoping Futura’s capable son will complete a hat-trick of wins, in the 2021 Zimbabwe Derby. The three-year-old gelding has only raced twice and attracted admirers on each occasion. His last outing was in the Zimbabwe 2000, on April 18, and he handled that trip well. Sunday’s race is over 2400 metres and none of the runners have tried that yet. Diesel And Dust is from the Swanson yard, and he will be taking on his stable companions, Magnus Maximus and Rocquette. Bridget Stidolph will saddle Only Him, by Mambo In Seattle (USA), a recent arrival at Borrowdale. Also lightly raced, Only Him won over 1400m at The Vaal, and at the last Borrowdale meeting, he ran two lengths off Hedwig, over 1600m. Magnus Maximus, by Jackson, is a three-time winner — twice over 1200m, and the 1600m Guineas Trial on January 17, where he narrowly beat Obscure. The Jay Peg filly, Rocquette, is still a maiden but has had several races around the turn. To date she has been, somewhat, unreliable but, in this field, where the ability to stay the Derby distance matters, she has to be taken on trust. Diesel And Dust has proved himself over 2000m and looks to be the one the others must beat. The seven race card has seen 42 runners committing for Sunday.
