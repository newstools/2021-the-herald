The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo-Senior Lifestyle Writer More often than not, events throughout the world get their splendour and grandeur from the arenas they are performed. Grand arenas, give colour, depth of character and credence to events. Wimbledon, for instance, gives tennis tournaments their real meaning, Stadia Benabueu, gives Spanish football its credence, Caesar’s Palace and Trump Plaza give boxing its contact sports aura. When an arena has a complex and interlocking chambers for simultaneous hosting events it is called a conundrum or hippodrome. It shapes the image of the event. Hippodrome of Constantinople was an arena used for chariot racing throughout the Byzantine period. First it was built during the reign of Roman emperor Septimius Severus in the early 3rd century CE, the structure was made more grandiose by emperor Constantine I in the 4th century CE The Roman Hippodrome in Istanbul, Turkey. It served as an ancient racetrack where historical chariot races, major social events and athletic competitions were held. It was decorated with the Egyptian Obelisk and other famous columns along its spina, a raised central platform used to divide the race track. Its construction began in 203 by the Emperor Septimus Severus and it was subsequently enlarged by Constantine the Great. According to one estimation, it had a capacity for an audience of 100 000 people. It was approximately 429 metres long and 119 meters wide in an oval formation. After the Nika riots in 532, the chariot races lost their importance and in 1204, during the fourth crusade, it was greatly damaged and gradually fell into ruins. Some archaeological remains found underground of the Hippodrome can be visited at the nearby Museum of Turkish and Islamic Arts. With that in mind, how many hippodromes you know of in Africa? Yes, there is famous one in Mali which is in Quartier of Bamako. One can find many restaurants, bars, food stores and hotels in the Quartier. Earlier in April, the country received news that charismatic, philanthropist and televangelist Ambassador at Large Uebert Angel is building one. <img class="size-full wp-image-547996" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/Hippodrome.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/Hippodrome.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/Hippodrome-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> An artistic impression of the hippodrome set to be built by Ambassador at Large Uebert Angel. His philanthropic work is there to silence all his doubting Thomases. In his early 40s, he has defied odds as a man of the cloth whose teachings continue to touch hearts of man. With news that he is constructing a 6 400-seater Harare Hippodrome and the Beethoven Hotel with 40 executive rooms in Harare’s Braeside suburb, Ambassador Angel has distinguished himself from other men of the cloth, as a game changer who has proved that men of the cloth can fully utilise their influence in nation building. His charisma, influence and word have no doubt inspired many that Christianity can change then lives of many. The Herald on Saturday Lifestyle had an interview with one of Ambassador at Large, Angel’s project manager Felix Angel who shared the insight and plan of the hippodrome. Currently the Ambassador at Large is in the United Kingdom on a business trip and personal as he is based there. A lot of people want to know, what it will look like, who is to benefit and does the investment going to affect the surroundings? “To begin with, there are two projects on that land where Ambassador wants to construct a hotel dubbed, “The BeetHoven Hotel” and “The Harare Hippodrome”, said Angel He confirmed that the Harare Hippodrome is an Elite multi-purpose conference centre with a sitting capacity of 6400 people. “It is going to be the biggest indoor, conference centre in Zimbabwe. It will have rooms, coffee-shop and other complementing spaces that will serve different purposes like the gym and saloon among others. The BeetHoven Hotel is a four storey building completely separate from the hippodrome with 40 executive suites. The Harare International Conference Centre has sitting capacity of 4 500, The City Sports Centre has sitting capacity for only 4 200 and the Harare Hippodrome will have a sitting capacity of 6 400,” he explained. Angel said that construction has already begun but did not want to share the details of the architecture. Asked what inspired the idea to have one in Zimbabwe, Angel said that Ambassador had been thinking about the idea for years and waited for the perfect timing. “This is an investment he had always been thinking for a few years. The Ambassador had been concentrating on other projects where he is currently based in the United Kingdom. I guess in the new Second Republic, we saw that it was the right time to invest and support our nation,” he said. He added that for the Harare Hippodrome to be completed it needs a workforce of about 200 people. “Our target workforce includes almost 200 people who will be on the ground working, and when fully functional we intend to create fifty job offers,” he said. However, others queried that, since it is more of an investment, does that mean the houses built in that area, surroundings market prices will go up? Will that affect the model of Braeside residential area? “Emphatically yes, which is a plus for the neighbourhood,” he jumped to say. “The good thing is that we are promoting the Buy Zimbabwe campaign hence we will be using some of the raw materials from local, except for a few which will be imported. “For some parts of the scenery, not only to accommodate the global market and meeting the international standards, some of the flowers are going to be imported.” Angel said after completion, the first port of call is to host a musical concert. “It will also host musical concert’s and many of similar nature,” he said.
