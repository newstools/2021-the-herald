The Herald LONDON. — Manchester United are prepared to sell star midfielder Paul Pogba this summer should he fail to sign a new mega-deal at the English Premiership football club, according to reports. Pogba is happier than at any time since a world-record £89 million move to rejoin the club from Juventus in 2016 and was outstanding in United’s 6-2 win against Roma in last week’s Europa League semi-final first leg. The Frenchman’s current United contract runs out next year amid protracted speculation linking him with a move to Real Madrid. The Mirror however, claim United will open talks with the 28-year-old regarding a fresh £400 000-a-week deal later this month, which would see him overtake David De Gea as the highest-paid player at the club. But the same outlet and The Sun claim that should the France international refuse to commit his long-term future to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men, the club will not hesitate to move him on, especially if super agent Mino Raiola’s demands become too taxing. To help finance a move, both reports add United are planning to sell Spain goalkeeper De Gea – who currently earns £350 000 per week — to fund his current French team-mate’s new deal, with Dean Henderson then becoming the undisputed No. 1. But United are aware that they are in a race against time to convince Pogba to stay and are keen for progress to be made on negotiations. — Mailonline.
