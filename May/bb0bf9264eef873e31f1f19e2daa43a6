The Herald Fungai Lupande Mashonaland Central Bureau First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa’s traditional food cook out competitions at ward level have started in Mashonaland Central. The competitions follow the launch of the traditional meals programme at the Zimbabwe Ezekiel Guti University (ZEGU) in March by the First Lady.  Chief Masembura’s wife, Mrs Barbra Charakupa and the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation are organising the competitions at this level, with provincial competitions set for June. Mrs Charakupa said they cascaded the campaign to the household level through village heads and the programme has received tremendous support.
