The Herald Prosper Dembedza Court Correspondent The trial for Criminal Investigations Department (CID) director Commissioner Chrispen Charumbira, who is facing criminal abuse of office charges, failed to kick off today following indications that there are two records which need to be merged. Prosecutor Mr Ephraim Zinyandu told the court of the two records. Harare regional magistrate Mr Stanford Mambanje deferred the matter to May 26 following the Stateâ€™s application for a postponement. Charumbira (49), is facing three counts of attempting to defeat the course of justice and is on $10 000 bail.
