The Herald Zvamaida Murwira Senior Reporter The Zimbabwe Republic Police has decried inadequate equipment to effectively curb mineral leakages at several ports such as borders and international airports. Commissioner General Godwin Matanga said they needed scanners, drones and high powered vehicles to effectively patrol and monitor activities at ports of entry. He said this today while giving oral evidence before a joint Parliament portfolio committee on Mines and Mining Development together with that of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage, Defence and Security. Both committees wanted to know what law enforcement agencies were doing to curb leakages at ports of entry given recent incidents of people found with minerals such as gold at international airports.
