The Herald LONDON. — What about Lille selling Nicolas Pepe and Gabriel to Arsenal for £95m and then using the money to win the French Ligue 1 title, for the first time, in 10 years? The Gunners could ony finish eighth in the English Premiership? Or Thomas Partey leaving Atletico Madrid, for £45.3m, only for Diego Simeone’s men to win the La Liga title, for the first time in seven years? The Ghanaian’s new club, Arsenal, will not play European football, for the first time, in a quarter-of-a-century? What about Jorginho, scoring just seven goals — all of them penalties — to finish as top scorer at Chelsea, the midfielder’s tally being the joint-lowest for the club since World War II? And, this is the same club which spent £179m on Timo Werner and Kai Havertz last summer, only for the Germany duo to score just 10 Premiership goals between them. Well, here are some of the interesting bits and pieces, as the curtains came down on the Premiership, and other major Euro leagues, at the weekend. Harry Kane is only the third player in Premiership history to finish with the most goals, and the most assists, in a single season (23 goals, 14 assists) — only the second time a player has done so after Andy Cole, in 1993-94. Sadio Mane (vs Crystal Palace) became just the second player to score in eight consecutive Premiership appearances against an opponent, after Robin van Persie against Stoke. Chelsea are the first side since Everton, in 1910-11, to finish in the top four in the English top-flight despite, having no player reach double-figures in the league, that season. Leicester spent more time (242 days) than any other team — (Manchester City 130 days), (Manchester United 155 days) and Liverpool (139 days) — in the top four but, they dropped out, on the final day of the season on Sunday. For the third time this season, Jamie Vardy scored two penalties in a single league game, becoming the first player in Premiership history to do so, as many as three times, in a single campaign. No team has scored more penalties in this season’s Premiership than Leicester City (nine, level with Manchester United). No player has been involved in more goals in all competitions for Arsenal, this season, than Nicolas Pepe (15 goals, five assists). Arsenal haven’t lost their final league game of the season since 2004-05 (1-2 vs Birmingham), and have won each of their last 10 games, to end a Premier League campaign. Bertrand Traore is the 25th different player to score against Chelsea in the Premiership, having played for the Blues in the competition — no team has had more different former players score against them (Spurs also 25). Manchester United became just the fourth side to remain unbeaten away from home across an entire English top-flight campaign (P19 W12 D7 L0), after Preston (1888-89), Arsenal (2001-02) and Arsenal again (2003-04). Sergio Agüero’s second goal against Everton on Sunday finished off a 42-pass move by Manchester City, it was the longest run of passes in the build up to a Premiership goal since November 2018, when lkay Gündogan scored following a 44-pass move against Manchester United. Agüero scored two goals, as a substitute for Manchester City, for only the second time, the first being his club debut against Swansea City in August 2011. Phil Foden has played a direct hand in 26 goals for Manchester City in all competitions this season (16 goals and 10 assists), the second-most of any City player after Kevin De Bruyne (28). Anthony Elanga is the 19th different teenager to score a Premier League goal for Manchester United — only Arsenal (20) have had more teenagers find the net for them in the competition’s history. Manchester United have lost their final league game in just one of their last 14 seasons (W10 D3), losing 2-0 v Cardiff in 2018-19). When finishing their Premier League campaign away from home, the Red Devils are unbeaten in 11 games (W8 D3), since losing at Spurs in 2000-01. Joe Willock is only the second Newcastle player to score in seven consecutive Premier League appearances, after Alan Shearer in 1996. Carlo Ancelotti suffered the heaviest defeat of his managerial career in what is his 1,167th game in management (Man City 5-0 Everton). Gareth Bale averaged a goal every 84 minutes in the Premier League this season. For players with 10+ goals, only Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 1998-99 has a better mins/goal ratio in a single season in the competition (one every 71 mins). — OptaJoe/Bleacher Report
