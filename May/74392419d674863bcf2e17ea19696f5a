The Herald Prosper Dembedza Court Correspondent Senior lawyer Simplisius Julius Chihambakwe who is facing allegations of failing to declare his interests to the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) where he was a board member when his law firm started collecting money owed to authority has made a request for further particulars. Some of the particulars being requested by Chihmabakwe include Zesa Holdings’ memorandum and articles of association, consultative documents governing the relationship between Zesa and ZETDC and a schedule of all remittances to Zesa made by the law firm in terms of any debt collection agreement. Chihambakwe, through his lawyer Advocate Zhuwarara made the request saying they needed the particulars before trial commencement. The matter was deferred  to June 19 where the State is supposed to provide the further particulars as per the request. Chihambakwe, of Chihambakwe, Mutizwa and Partners is charged with corruptly concealing an interest from a principal. While collecting Zesa debts, the law firm earned US$3 098 248 commission. The State led by Ms Sheila Mupindu alleges that in January 2016, Chihambakwe, Mutizwa and Partners started collecting debts on behalf of Zesa’s distribution arm, ZETDC, without signing a contract. At the time, Chihambakwe was a board member of Zesa and he allegedly failed to disclose his interests.
