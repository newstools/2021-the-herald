The Herald Fidelis Munyoro Chief Court Reporter THE National Prosecuting Authority says it will appeal the decision to acquit the police Mashonaland West Armoury officer-in- charge and his wife on charges of illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition. Last week, Inspector Clive Kadambure  and his wife Shyness Kadambure were cleared of charges illegal possession of a firearm and live ammunition. The gun and ammunition were discovered in the family garden after police detectives swooped on the couple’s home in March. Chinhoyi provincial magistrate Mrs Ruth Moyo cleared the couple of the charges after the State failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, the pair’s connection to the six recovered rifles that were destined for Mozambique. However, the NPA was not satisfied with the trial court’s decision and announced its intention to appeal. “This is totally a travesty of justice,” said chief law officer Mr Justin Uladi, adding, “As NPA, we are definitely going to appeal against this judgment.” The swoop came after the arrest of two men on March 15 in Gonarezhou National Park while trying to smuggle six semi-automatic rifles into Mozambique through Sango Border Post. Shyness Kadambure, a teacher at Alaska Primary School, was hauled into the matter for allegedly hiding her husband’s CZ service pistol and 58 x .375 Honardy Ruger bullets in the couple’s garden in Hunyani suburb after getting wind he was wanted for gun crimes. The CZ pistol and ammunition were recovered by police after Kadambure’s wife gave directions to where she had hidden them. However, the State failed to prove a prima facie case against the couple, leading to their acquittal. Mr Fortune Murisi represented the couple while Mr Herald Matura appeared for the State.
