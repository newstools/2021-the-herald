The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Sports Reporter DESPITE facing several challenges in their fight to stay in the Rainbow Amateur Netball League, Lusumbami chairperson Thembinkosi Muremba says they will not give up and have since confirmed their participation in the 2021 season, in the event competition resumes. So far 17 clubs under RANL have confirmed their participation and ability to meet the Covid-19 requirements when the game return. The league and its members are still to agree on the format in which their games will resume, when competition finally gets underway after more than a year of inactivity. Apart from financial challenges, the club also lost some of their senior players during the long Covid-19 induced break. However, they have since embarked on a rebuilding exercise so that they have a competitive team in place. Muremba, who is the founder of the club, said being the only representatives from Matabeleland North in the league, they do not want to disappoint their community, which has shown interest in the sport. “We didn’t want to pull out citing sponsorship…We are still working on that and we won’t fail. “I am still on my own but we are still running around, one way or the other we will manage to fulfil our games. “I like the approach our sponsor for the league has taken, he has showed that zeal, the passion to keep netball alive, so I also want to keep on giving support. “We have started to build our team. We are the only team in Matabeleland North and the community has so much interest, so I think we will come up with a strong team. “The coach and manager have been consulting with some of the Division One clubs and we are also engaging districts around Hwange in our rebuilding exercise,” said Muremba. The team is also looking at holding trials before the end of this month.
