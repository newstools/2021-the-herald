The Herald BERLIN. — Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski scored in the last minute of the season to break Gerd Muller’s 49-year record of German Bundesliga goals in a campaign in his side’s 5-2 win over Augsburg on Saturday. Lewandowski Muller’s 49-year-old record when he bagged a 41st Bundesliga goal of the campaign seconds before the final whistle on the last weekend of the season. Muller (75) is suffering from severe dementia, but “The Bomber” remains an iconic figure in German football as the Bundesliga’s all-time top scorer with 365 goals, well ahead of Lewandowski’s tally of 277. Many thought Muller’s record of 40 goals for Bayern Munich in 1971/72 would never be matched until Lewandowski rounded the goalkeeper to score in the same club’s 5-2 rout of Augsburg on Saturday after equalling the record last weekend. “It was tense until the last second, I would have liked to have scored earlier,” a relieved Lewandowski told Sky. “Sometimes you also have to stay patient, which was difficult. “I always believed that a chance would come. That was a special and historic moment.” While Muller scored his 40 goals over 34 league games in 1971/72, injury and squad rotation meant Lewandowski broke the record in just 29 matches. Bayern scored 101 goals in the league in 1971/72 and 99 this season. Physically, the 32-year-old Lewandowski is very different to Muller, who was 26 in the 1971/72 season. “Robert is an athlete, Gerd was an artist,” Muller’s wife – Uschi Muller – told magazine Sport Bild. At 1.84m and 79kgs, Lewandowski is a model athlete, renowned for his strict diet and training programme. Muller, at 1.76m and 80kgs in his prime, was nicknamed “short fat Mueller” by former Bayern coach Zlatko Cajkovski. — BBC Sport.
