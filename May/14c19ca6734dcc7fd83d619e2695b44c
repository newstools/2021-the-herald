The Herald MANCHESTER. — Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola said striker Sergio Aguero is close to agreeing a deal to join Barcelona. Aguero is set to leave at the end of the season as a free agent after City’s Champions League football final against Chelsea on Saturday. The 32-year-old signed off from the English Premier League in perfect style on Sunday, scoring twice as the champions finished with a 5-0 win over Everton. Speaking afterwards, former Barcelona manager Guardiola revealed City’s record goalscorer is on the verge of joining Argentina team-mate Lionel Messi in Spain. “Maybe I reveal a secret. Maybe he is close to agreeing a deal for the club of my heart – for Barcelona,” Guardiola told Match of the Day. “He is going to be playing alongside the best player of all time, Messi. “I’m pretty sure he is going to enjoy,” Guardiola added. “And maybe Barcelona are stronger and stronger with him on the pitch.” Aguero, who has won five Premier League titles, told Sky Sports after the win over Everton: “Before the game, I felt so strange, the sensation is not good. I prefer to think about the good moments. “I’m a striker, my target is to score goals, so I’m so happy because it’s my last game and to score two goals is fantastic for me. “When I came here the first title for me was the most important, for the club and for me. Then Man City started to win more titles so I’m so happy because it’s not easy to be 10 years at one club, for me, it’s an honour.” — Sky Sports
