The Herald Prosper Dembedza Court Correspondent The key witness in the trial of former Mines and Mining Development Minister Walter Chidhakwa and his former permanent secretary Francis Gudyanga has been finally brought before the  court following a warrant of arrest issued against him on October 25 2020. Chidhakwa and Gudyanga are facing separate charges of abuse of office. The trial was supposed to continue yesterday but failed as the key witness Richard Chingodza was not available. Asked by Harare regional magistrate on why he defaulted court on October 25 last year, Chingodza said he was not feeling well. “During that time, I was at the farm doing land preparation. On the day that I was supposed to come to Harare, I fell ill,” he said. Mr Mambanje cancelled the warrant of arrest and warned Chingodza to appear in court on June 2 for trial continuation.
