A Chitungwiza student wrote his Advanced Level in nine months to reduce the school fees burden on his parents and scored 13 points. Mike Lungu, completed his A-Level while at Faith Learning Centre in less a year after realising the financial burden on his family. In an interview with Youth Interactive, Mike said was looking for a scholarship so that he can proceed to university. “I wrote my O-Level in 2019 and it was not easy as my parents were not able to pay well for my school fees. “I then proceeded to A-Level of which I had to complete it in nine months to cut the burden short. “Had I waited for two years, I would not have written the exams,” said Mike. He said his parents are not in good health and it was not easy for them to provide fees for his academic journey. “Things are not well and my parents are not in good state of health. “I started A-Level in March 2020 and wrote my exams in December of the same year where I managed to come out with 13 points. “I did this to differentiate myself with my contemporaries so that I can source for scholarship and I am set for the extraordinary through the support of family members. “I am looking forward to going to university level to study law. “For now I am grounded as I have nowhere to start from; I am seeking help from the well-wishers to assist me with financial support. “I will be very comfortable to get tangible help and I just want to urge my fellow academic pursuers to work hard and know that it is possible to finish schooling before the stipulated time frame,” he added. Lungu studied History, Sociology and Family and Religious Studies and scored two B’s and an ‘A’. the ‘A’ was in sociology.
