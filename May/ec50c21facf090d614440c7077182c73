The Herald Tadious Manyepo in Zvishavane A brace by newboy Valentine Kadonzvo helped Ngezi Platinum Stars to a 3-0 victory over Hwahwa in the Chibuku Super Cup tie played at Mandava this afternoon. After missing the opening tie against Triangle last week due to registration issues, Kadonzvo was given a starting berth ahead of Nyasha Chintuli in the only change made by coach Rodwell Dhlakama from last weekâ€™s team. And the former Dynamos and Chicken Inn winger duly repaid the faith with a wonder goal in the sixth minute and he followed that with a simple tap in four minutes from the break. His goals were sandwiched by a fortutious ricochet by an impressive Wellington Taderera. Although the Mhondoro team tried to add to their tally in the second half, Hwahwa made sure they kept the score line a bit respectable especially given that they lost their opener against FC Platinum 6-0 last week. Ngezi maintained their second place because they have scored less goals compared to FC Platinum who lead the standings. Teams
