A 32-year-old Chegutu man yesterday appeared in court after he was arrested whilst trying to steal a Zesa transformer worth over $1,5million. Rangarirai Zhuwawu was facing charges of contravening the electricity act when he appeared before Harare magistrate Mr Dennis Mangosi.
He was remanded in custody and advised to apply bail at the High Court. The court heard that on May 26 Zhuwawu who was in the company of his accomplice who is still at large approached the Granary Phase 1B Pump Station where they climbed two concrete ZESA poles (H-pole) and cut cables which supply electricity to the adjacent 500KVA transformer housed about 10 metres from the poles. It is the State’s case that they proceeded to the transformer where they damaged the padlock securing the door where the transformer is housed. It is alleged that whilst inside they removed the screws and bolts on the transformer. The court heard that when the security guards who were nearby realised the electricity had gone off they headed straight to the transformer where they were confronted by the two accused persons who pelted them with stones and the guards fled. The two accused persons gave chase and started breaking all the window panes on the guards’ residence. The guards sought help from members of the community who assisted in apprehending Zhuwawo whilst his accomplice disappeared into the darkness. He was handed over to police detectives who questioned him and he led the detectives to where he had hidden his satchel with his personal clothes. Upon arrest, he was wearing a woolen hood over his face and head as well as black leggings.
