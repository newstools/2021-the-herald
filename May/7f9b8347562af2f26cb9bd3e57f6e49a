The Herald Tadious Manyepo-Sports Reporter IF there is something called proving a point in football, then four Cranborne Bullets players would like to do so against Black Rhinos at Sakuba, this afternoon. They are Martin Mine, Kelvin Chiripawako, Wonder Kapinda, Yusuf Wasili and Douglas Mbewe. The two sister army sides put their friendship aside when they cross swords in a Chibuku Super Cup battle. The match kicks off at 1pm. Rhinos top the pool, because of a superior goal difference, having thrashed Tenax 4-1 in the opener last week. Cranborne, who beat Manica Diamonds 1-0, can also fancy their chances. Chiripawako, Kapinda, Mbewe, Mine and Wasili was discarded by Rhinos coach, Herbert Maruwa, and were adopted by Cranborne Bullets gaffer, Nesbert “Yabo” Saruchera. “This is a fixture that is rich in every aspect,” Saruchera said. “It is a fixture that all the players, from both teams, have always looked forward to. It has come a bit early but that is what football is all about. “Black Rhinos have all the experience but we definitely have the determination. We have been preparing and all my players are fit, and available, for selection. ‘’There is more at stake than just the three points. We have so many players in our fold, who once played for Black Rhinos, and that alone should motivate them to play well.’’ The quintet, meanwhile, have elected to remain diplomatic, only declaring their readiness for what should be a real battle at Sakubva.
