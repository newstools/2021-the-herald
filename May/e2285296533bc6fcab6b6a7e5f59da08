The Herald Conrad Mupesa Mashonaland West Bureau A 23-year-old woman who in 2018 allegedly connived with her husband to gruesomely murder a fellow worker before fleeing to Mozambique after stealing US$6 000 was apprehended by police last week. Tabeth Mashizha of Muzanenhamo Village under Chief Chirau was nabbed by police after a tip off last Friday when she attended an apostolic church service in Zvimba district, three years after committing the murder case. Appearing before Chinhoyi provincial magistrate, Ms Tamari Chibindi, on Tuesday facing murder charges, Mashizha was advised to apply for bail at the High Court. Prosecutor Mr Review Nikisi said on August 23, 2018 at Masabera homestead in Gwamba Village, Mashizha and her husband Stanford Mazibiye (also known as Farai Sithole) whose age was not given and is still at large believed to be in Mozambique, killed Ms Netty Mangachaya whom they worked with as domestic workers. The two struck Ms Mangachaya several times on her head and face using an axe and a hammer before killing her and then ransacked the house and made off with US$6 000.
