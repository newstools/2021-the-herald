The Herald Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter WARRIORS coach Zdravko Logarusic has called a 30-member squad, including Europe-based professionals, for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers. The French Ligue 1 duo of Marshall Munetsi and Tino Kadewere are back in the fold along with the England-based quartet of Marvelous Nakamba, Tendayi Darikwa, Jordan Zemura and Admiral Muskwe. These players missed the Warriorsâ€™ previous assignment in the 2021 AFCON Qualifiers because of coronavirus travel restrictions in Europe. Former Everton defender, Brendan Galloway, who recently announced his availability for Zimbabwe, has also been called up. Knowledge Musona is expected to lead the side in the opening two matches of the World Cup qualifiers next month. Attacking midfielder, Khama Billiat, who has been a huge doubt because of injury, is also in the squad while Divine Lunga makes his return. Zimbabwe are set to begin their quest against South Africa in the first week of June at the National Sports Stadium. They will then travel to Ethiopia the following week before meeting Ghana in back-to-back qualifiers scheduled for September.
