The Herald BEIJING. – Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday witnessed via video link the groundbreaking ceremony of four advanced nuclear reactors powered by Russia’s third-generation nuclear technology in China. Observers said that the start of construction on the four new nuclear reactors, the biggest China-Russia nuclear energy cooperation project to date, marks a milestone in China-Russia nuclear energy cooperation and is further proof that the two countries are moving closer in the face of escalating US sanctions and restrictions. Nuclear cooperation is of great strategic significance due to its direct relation to energy security and national security, as well as global governance and challenges like climate change and non-proliferation. Cooperation between the two major nuclear powers and permanent members of the UN Security Council is of global significance, Chinese experts said. The four nuclear generating units – two at the Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant in East China’s Jiangsu Province and two at the Xudapu Nuclear Plant in Northeast China’s Liaoning Province – have a reported combined power generation output of 37,6 billion kilowatt hours a year upon completion, and will reduced carbon emissions by 30,68 million tons. The event yesterday saw China’s fleet of nuclear power reactors that are approved for or under construction become the world’s largest, increasing to 23 from 19. – Global Times.
