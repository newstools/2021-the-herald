The Herald THE future looks uncertain for Zimbabwean football players as Nkana FC stare relegation in the Zambian Super League. Warriors’ goalkeeper Talbert Shumba, midfielder Tichaona Chipunza and defenders Kelvin Moyo, Jimmy Dzingai and Takudzwa Chimwemwe are in the books of the defending champions. Nkana sunk deeper in the relegation waters on Sunday when they lost 3-0 to Green Eagles. Although they have four games in hand, the team has managed a single point from the last seven matches and appears to fail to tame the slide. Also in trouble in the Zambian Premiership is Napsa Stars defender Dennis Dauda. Over the weekend, Dauda’s team lost 2-1 to Green Buffaloes and are five points from safety with five games in hand. Zimbabwean FIFA intermediary Trust Nyambiya, the manager of Shumba, Chipunza, and Moyo told The Herald that he is optimistic about the team’s survival. “I think they can survive. We still wish and hope that the team survives, but should that not happen, we have to move on,” said Nyambiya. “When a player signs for such a club, they would want to leave a mark, but things didn’t go as expected. “Kelvin is back into the team after missing 10 games due to Malaria. He was in Zimbabwe but has since returned and done well in the games he has played. “His contract ends in June, but the club loves him and wants a contract extension. Talbert is on loan from Chapungu while Tichaona contract ends next year in February,” Nyambiya said. The agent says he will keep his options open since football is now business.
