Econet founder Mr Strive Masiyiwa has become the first black billionaire to break into The Sunday Times Rich List, which also has a number of foreigners. Mr Masiyiwa, who was born in Zimbabwe, is not a British citizen according to an investigation by The Herald contrary to claims in some global media organisations. His wealth is estimated to be £1,087 billion, generated largely from the telecoms sector. Other foreigners on the list include Ukrainian-born, Sir Leonard Blavatnik (63) who has topped the Rich List for the second time with his £23 billion fortune after a £7,2 billion jump in wealth. London-based Sri Hinduja (85) who was born in India, also makes the Rich List.
