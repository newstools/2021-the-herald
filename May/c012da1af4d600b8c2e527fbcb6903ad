The Herald Prosper Dembedza Court Correspondent The fourth witness in the trial of suspended University of Zimbabwe Vice Chancellor Levi Nyagura, former Cabinet Minister Tichaendepi Robert Masaya, has told the court that no favour or disfavour was shown by accused in the conferment of a PhD degree to former First Lady Ntombizodwa Grace Mugabe. Mr Masaya, who became the dean of the Faculty of Social Social Studies after Mugabe had already been accepted as a student, made the revelations during cross examination from Advocate Tawanda Zhuwarara who is representing Nyagura on allegations of illegally awarding her the PhD degree. During the cross examination, Mr Masaya stated that he was appointed as the dean in the Faculty of Social Studies after Mugabe was accepted as a student by the University of Zimbabwe. He said he had no evidence proving that Nyagura showed favour or disfavour to Mugabe to become a student at the university. During cross examination from prosecutor Mr Tapiwa Godzi, Mr Masaya told the court that he only came to know that Mugabe was graduating with a PhD degree after Nyagura had given him a list of students who were graduating that year, saying he should familiarise with her first name which he said was difficult to pronounce. The ex-Minister also stated that he did not know of Mugabeâ€™s documents up until the graduation period.
