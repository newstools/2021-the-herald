The Herald Tadious Manyepo in ZVISHAVANE Triangle……… (1) 1
Ngezi …………..(1) 3 NGEZI Platinum Stars came from behind to beat Triangle in a thrilling Chibuku Super Cup tie at Mandava this afternoon.
Triangle captain Collins Dhuwa opened the scoring for the Chiredzi side in the sixth minute before double-scorer Denver Mukamba equalised on the quarter hour mark. Ngezi never looked back and they took the initiative in the second half with Marvellous Mukumba thrusting them ahead with 17 minutes to play. Triangle coach Taurai Mangwiro added more fire power by throwing in experienced forward Ralph Matema but he was tightly monitored.
Instead, it was Mukamba who stretched Ngezi’s lead at the end to cap a fine day in the office. Ngezi are sitting on second place, with three points, same as leaders FC Platinum who have a superior goal difference, after they walloped Hwahwa 6-0 yesterday. Teams Triangle United
