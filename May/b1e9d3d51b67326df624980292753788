The Herald JOHANNESBURG. – South Africa’s Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has confirmed that the government is on ‘high alert’ this week, after a number of incidents reported in the past 24 hours raised fears about the arrival of a new coronavirus variant on its shores. The B.1.617 strain, colloquially termed the ‘Indian variant’ due to where it was discovered, carries a mutation that may be driving a new deadly wave. India has been decimated by a rapid spread of new cases, a spike in deaths, and hospitals that are overwhelmed by demand. Mkhize and his colleagues are taking the threat seriously, but there may be a spanner in the works. A number of incidents – which have the potential to bring the Indian variant into South Africa – have been reported on both Monday and yesterday. According to Mkhize, scientific advisors are now deciding how to handle possible ‘variants of concern’, should genomic sequencing discover if the so-called ‘double-mutation’ is now in South Africa. “Government has consulted members of the Ministerial Advisory Committee to advise on the approach to managing travellers from countries that have variants of concern. Their advice will assist us to determine the next steps forward, of which government will announce in due course,” he said. A traveller from India tested positive for Covid-19 after landing in South Africa this week. The patient is now in an isolated facility in KZN, for further tests are being carried out on Tuesday. An Indian cargo ship that docked in Durban harbour on Sunday is being quarantined. This follows the death of a crew member on board, after 14 workers on the vessel returned positive Covid-19 tests.  – News.com
