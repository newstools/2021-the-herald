The Herald MAPUTO. – Ethiopian Mozambique Airlines (EMA) has announced the indefinite suspension of domestic flights, starting tomorrow, due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the civil aviation sector. In a press release issued on Workers’ Day, the Ethiopian Airlines subsidiary explains that the suspension “results from the decline in demand among travellers due to restrictions imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic”. “Despite the challenges, Ethiopian Mozambique Airlines remained resiliently operational until the economic challenges of the pandemic became so severe that they made continuity impossible due to the drastic drop in demand for travel in the domestic market,” the statement said, while promising that the company will remain attentive to the evolution of the market. Ethiopian Mozambique Airlines started its operations in December 2018. – Carta de Moçambique.
