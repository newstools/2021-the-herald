The Herald LONDON. — José Mourinho is to take over as manager of Roma next season, the Italian Serie A football club have announced. Roma have confirmed the shock appointment of Mourinho just over two weeks on from his departure at Tottenham. The Italian club have issued a statement unveiling the Portuguese as their new boss just three hours after announcing that Paulo Fonseca will be leaving his position as manager at the end of the season. The Portuguese was sacked by Tottenham last month and is returning to Italy, where he had a successful spell with Internazionale. Roma had earlier said that Fonseca would leave his role as head coach at the end of this season. “The club are delighted to announce an agreement has been reached with José Mourinho for him to become our new head coach ahead of the 2021-22 season,” Roma said. Mourinho was at Inter for two seasons from 2008-09, winning the Italian Serie A twice and the Champions League before departing for Real Madrid. Roma are seventh this season and unlikely to finish any higher. Tomorrow they play at home to Manchester United in the second leg of their Europa League semi-final, trailing 6-2. Roma’s president, Dan Friedkin, and vice-president, Ryan Friedkin, said: “We are thrilled and delighted to welcome José Mourinho into the AS Roma family. A great champion who has won trophies at every level, José will provide tremendous leadership and experience to our ambitious project. “The appointment of José is a huge step in building a long-term and consistent winning culture throughout the club.” — The Guardian.
