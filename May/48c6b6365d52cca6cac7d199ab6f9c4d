The Herald LONDON. — Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp likened his side’s 3-0 victory at Burnley on Wednesday night to winning “a semi-final” which takes them to Sunday’s “final” against Crystal Palace. A cool finish from Roberto Firmino turned the game Liverpool’s way then a first club goal for Nathaniel Phillips and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s late drive made the points safe and improved the Reds’ goal difference. The Reds are now in the fourth Champions League spot, level on points with fifth-placed Leicester City and with a goal difference four better than the Foxes. Klopp’s side host the Eagles with 10,000 fans inside Anfield. “Today was a semi-final,” Klopp told Sky Sports. “We had to win the semi-final and we did. “Nothing is decided yet but we improved our position and we have the final. That’s what we needed. It’s what we deserve because this was a top performance. “Now we have to make sure we recover quickly. We have a thin squad in some positions. We have to wrap them in cotton wool. “I can’t wait for the 10 000 fans at Anfield. Nothing is decided — Palace are strong.” Having required a sensational injury-time goal from goalkeeper Alisson to complete a comeback and beat West Brom at the weekend, the Reds endured another stressful encounter at Turf Moor. They were harried all over the pitch throughout by a committed home side keen to impress their 3,000 fans and provide them with an end to a terrible run of home form. — BBC Sport.
