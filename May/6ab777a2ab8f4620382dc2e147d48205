The Herald Nyore Madzianike Senior Court Reporter A member of a syndicate that roams around the Registrar General’s offices in Harare, fleecing desperate passport seekers of money, Nicholas Chogugudza, today admitted in court to soliciting for bribes on behalf of the passport office’s employees. Chogugudza, who was arrested along with an official from the passport offices, Prisca Moyo, today admitted to the offence when he appeared before Harare regional magistrate Mr Stanford Mambanje. “I would want to tell the court the truth in front of everyone, including those who arrested me, that I committed the offence,” he said. He was being charged with bribery. Chogugudza hangs around Makombe Building as a link between the public and RG’s employees facilitating the underhand dealings. The State will separately prosecute Moyo on criminal abuse of office and bribery.
