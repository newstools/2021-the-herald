The deal will see the Premier Soccer League getting US$$1 130 000 per season. The money will be payable in local currency at the bank rate of the day. The sponsorship package was announced by Delta Corporation General Manager, Patricia Murambinda. She told guests at the launch ceremony in Harare today that Delta are committed to see the resumption of football after a year of absence due to Covid-19. The sponsorship package will be channeled towards three competitions up to 2023. “Delta is excited to announce the Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League sponsorship package for the 2021-2023 period. 2021 will be an exciting season for all, with various activities lined up to restart our game in Zimbabwe despite the Covid-19 challenges,” said Murambinda. The Castle Lager Premier Soccer League will get the lion’s share of US$700 000 per season while US$375 000 has been set aside for the Chibuku Super Cup that begins next week. Another US$55 000 will go towards the season-ending Castle Challenge Cup. The Challenge Cup features the winner of the main Castle Lager Premiership and the Chibuku Super Cup. The Chibuku Super Cup will kick-off the season next week in a new format where teams have been put in groups in the effort to manage a safe resumption of football after a year of inactivity due to the coronavirus pandemic. The previous format was a direct knockout but the new format will see clubs meeting in round-robin matches. The top two teams from each group will proceed to the quarter-finals. The semi-finals will be paired by the public drawing of the lots. The tournament is expected to run for six to eight weeks.
The Premier League season is expected to get underway in July.
