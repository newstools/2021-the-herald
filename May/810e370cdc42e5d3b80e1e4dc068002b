The Herald Walter Nyamukondiwa in Chirundu
The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has donated a tent, tables and chairs to be used at the Chirundu Border Post port health section to facilitate the safe screening of travelers for Covid 19 before they proceed to immigration and customs formalities. As part of a programme to promote safe trade in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, cross border traders are undergoing a four-day training and feedback programme to solicit challenges encumbering trade and formulate solutions. The consignment to be distributed to other port authorities also includes thermometers, sanitisers and liquid soaps to assist in the prevention of the spread of Covid-19. The project is funded by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) of the United Kingdom. Hurungwe District Development Coordinator Mr Andrew Tizora received the donation on behalf of the port authorities, saying a clear programme that supports efficient and safe movement of people in transit should be developed. “We wholeheartedly receive the donation from IOM and call for convergence of minds by all the port authorities to come up with a system that ensures people are quickly served in a safe environment,” said Mr Tizora. Cross border traders welcomed the donation saying current restrictions on their movement should be lifted through tailor-made health protocols targeted at them. Cross border traders were significantly affected by restriction imposed by governments in a bid to control the spread of Covid-19 by closing off borders. It emerged in the meeting that cross border traders have adopted other ways of getting their wares, including online trading, while stringent measures have led to some of them using illegal points in and out of the country.
