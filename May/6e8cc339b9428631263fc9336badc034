SEKE district has recorded the highest number of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI)s in Mashonaland East Province since the beginning of the lockdown putting its HIV prevalence rate at 12.7 percent, the National Aids Council (NAC) has revealed. Speaking during an HIV prevention awareness outreach in Seke, NAC District Aids Coordinator for Seke Mrs Florence Nyandoro said they were making efforts to combat new infections through the “Keep Affected Population Model.” Mrs Nyandoro said the model, which is targeting sex workers, is aimed at reducing new infections as they are being enlightened on the dangers of STIs and HIV and how best can they protect themselves through risk assessment programmes. “We did what we term hotspot mapping and realised that Seke district has the highest number of STIs in Mashonaland East,” she said. “Our STI cases were a cause for concern and were multiplying during the lockdown. We were a bit strained. We have a prevalence rate of 12.7 percent of HIV but we are happy that sex workers in this district are accepting the model. “They (sex workers) are taught about different types of STIs and we are encouraging early detection and treatment.” Mrs Nyandoro said they were making efforts in teaching sex workers in Seke district on how best they can prevent the spread of STIs and HIV. “We want ladies to know what to do when they encounter HIV. We have HIV prevention models through peer educators and we are also acting on Gender-Based Violence (GBV) issues in the community. “Each peer educator is expected to have 25 to 36 sex workers under her. They do risk assessment depending on the risk faced by the sex worker. They also produce reports with a manual on issues to do with self-awareness,” she said.
