The Herald Grace Chingoma Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE international and Stade Reims defensive midfielder Marshal Munetsi is proud to have clocked a personal milestone of 100 games in his career. His Sunday’s match against Monaco, albeit on a 0-1 defeat, was his 100th game at top level football. The 24-year-old midfielder managed to reach a century of matches after playing for three different top-flight clubs. Munetsi, who is enjoying game time in the French Ligue1, is optimistic that he will clock another 100 games. He has already played 43 games in Reim’s colours after moving to the French league in July 2019. Before the move, he had played 28 matches for South African Premiership giants Orlando Pirates. His initial contribution of 29 games in the top-flight league was with Baroka during the 2016/2017 season. Munetsi posted on his Twitter page on Monday: “Proud to have played 100 league games for three great clubs. Amazing memories, looking forward to the next 100. Thank you, Lord. 43 = Reims, 28 = Pirates, 29 = Baroka.” Munetsi, who extended his contract to 2024, can dare to dream that he will clock another milestone. He still has age on his side and his box-to-box type of play fits well into the demands of English football.
