The Herald Victor Maphosa Herald Reporter Government is happy with the progress so far on the expansion of the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport, despite delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Today, Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Felix Mhona toured the site to have an appreciation of the works, and the progress made in the upgrade of the airport.  Expansion will see the construction of the international terminal building and aprons, installation of four new bridges, a secondary radar system, construction of a VVIP pavilion and an airfield ground lighting and communication system.

What I really wanted to monitor is the time frame because we want to deliver according to the National Development Strategy 1 so that we meet our desired targets, and I am happy to say that we are on sync.  “I was asking the contractor on when the project will be finished and they assured me that by June next year we will have a finished product. This has also been confirmed by our local engineers. This is the work of the Second Republic. We are delivering according to the Vision 2030 that has been enshrined by President Mnangagwa.”
