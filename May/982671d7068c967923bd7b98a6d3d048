The Herald BARCELONA. — Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman said he expected his future at the club to be debated. This followed a horrendous second-half display, which saw his side slide to a 3-3 draw at Levante on Tuesday night, severely denting their hopes of winning the Spanish La Liga title. “Coaches are always being scrutinised but after a second half like that I’ll understand if there are questions about me,” the Dutchman told reporters. “We’re very disappointed and asking ourselves what happened in the second half. ‘’But we have to move on and try to prepare for next season.” Barca would have provisionally gone above Atletico Madrid, at the top of the table had they beaten Levante. The Catalans looked to be coasting towards victory after taking a 2-0 lead in the first half through goals from Lionel Messi and Pedri. But, they conceded twice in the space of three minutes after the break and although Ousmane Dembele put them back in front, some poor defending allowed Sergio Leon to equalise for Levante late on. “We were good in the first half, we played with pace and intensity and got ahead but we lost a lot of balls in dangerous positions in the second half and made lots of errors in defence,” Koeman said. “We reacted after it was 2-2 and got the goal but we made it too easy for them to score. ‘’Conceding three times in 45 minutes is not the level you expect from Barca. — AFP.
