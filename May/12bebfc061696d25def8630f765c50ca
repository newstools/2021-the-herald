The Herald George Maponga Masvingo Bureau A raging war between Gutu Rural District Council and the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) over control of water supply in Mpandawana town has been resolved, ushering in a new era which residents hope will end nagging water challenges in the sprawling urban settlement. Gutu RDC and Zinwa had for months been haggling, with the council demanding that the water authority surrender water supply responsibility to the local authority. Zinwa dug in, refusing and insisted on continuing to supply water to the town despite being at cross hairs with residents over failure to attend to faults on time while other parts of the town never received even a single drop of water. The tiff almost spilled into the courts. Gutu RDC chief executive Mr Alexander Mtembwa disclosed that the two parties had made peace. Mr Mtembwa said they agreed that Zinwa continues to supply water in the town and also improve efficiency to make sure all areas had running water. Mpandawana draws its water from Mushaviri Dam, about 10km from the urban settlement. Its rapid growth over the last decade led Government to according it town status, but challenges in water supply remain a threat to its future growth.
