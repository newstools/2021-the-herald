The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE Table Tennis Union have named a 10-member team that is set to represent the country at this year’s Chinese Ambassador’s Cup in Zambia next month. The players were selected after the annual National Top 16 Championships held in Ruwa recently and it saw the selection of players who will represent the country in Zambia from June 25 to 30. Top player Brian Chamboko will lead the men’s team and will have another seasoned campaigner Vikram Singh, who won the Top 16 men’s championship at Winwood College in Ruwa recently, in the same side. The duo will also have Tinotenda Fambira, Aidan Mabhaudhi and Nick Jani to complete the five players who will represent the country. In the women’s category, Ashley Dhlamini will be the trumpcard and will have Isheanesu Siringwani, Pauline Dube, Vimbai Makuvaza and Tsitsi Thebe in the team. The Chinese Ambassadors Cup is an annual event and returns to the table tennis circuit after a year as the 2020 edition was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Noah Ferenando, the Zimbabwe Table Tennis Union president, said they will work hard with the coaches as the players have not been active for quite some time. “We are happy with the team we selected through the National Top 16 Table Tennis Championships and we are hopeful that if they work hard they will bring us some medals. “The players are showing signs of rust but we believe the coaches will work with them and make sure they are back to their best form before the games. “The games have also come at a good time as we eye the Chinese Ambassador’s Cup in this country maybe in August before we participate at the African Union Sports Council Region V games later this year,” he said. Team Men: Brian Chamboko, Tinotenda Fambira, Aidan Mabhaudhi Vikram Singh, Nick Jani. Women: Ashley Dhlamini Isheanesu Siringwani, Pauline Dube, Vimbai Makuvaza, Tsitsi Thebe.
