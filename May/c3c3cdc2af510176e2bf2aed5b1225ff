Looking on is the PSL chief executive officer, Kenny Ndebele. Both the PSL chairman Farai Jere and his Zimpapers counterpart, Pikirayi Deketeke, hailed the new broadcast marriage as a “win-win” deal. Jere said the deal comes at the most opportune time as fans, who are the game’s biggest stakeholders, will not miss the action when football returns under the Covid-19 regulations where all matches will be played behind closed doors. <img class="size-full wp-image-547277" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/WhatsApp-Image-2021-05-12-at-13.59.26.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/WhatsApp-Image-2021-05-12-at-13.59.26.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/WhatsApp-Image-2021-05-12-at-13.59.26-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> DONE Deal… (From left to right) ZTN general manager Nomsa Nkala, Zimpapers Chief Executive Officer Pikirayi Deketeke, PSL chairman Farai Jere, PSL chief Executive Officer Kenny Ndebele and PSL Marketing Manager Rodwell Thabe pose for pictures after the signing ceremony. Deketeke said the Premier Soccer League and Zimpapers already had a long-standing partnership which has seen Premiership matches being covered by the newspapers under the organisation’s media stable. ZTN streamed last year’s Castle Challenge Cup between Highlanders and FC Platinum but this is the first time that the two entities have entered into a long-term deal, which promises excitement. “It’s really a milestone for us and we look forward to an exciting relationship. This might be television we are gathered here for but we have covered the Premiership in our newspapers for a long time. We look forward to spread out to other platforms like radio,” said Deketeke. The diversified media group was recently awarded a free-to-air television licence by the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe and are looking to get on air soon.
