The Herald LONDON – Mikel Arteta has paid a glowing tribute to Sergio Aguero ahead of the Manchester City striker’s final English Premier League game for the newly crowned English champions.  The 32-year-old’s contract is due to expire in the summer and, after 10 trophy-laden years at the Etihad, he is set to move on at the end of the campaign, with a transfer to Barcelona looking increasingly likely. “It was an absolute joy to work with him. “His character, his personality, he’s a loveable man and then one of the best talents that I’ve seen. “What he’s done in this league for so long, scoring the amount of goals that he’s done… I think he was a player that contributed to change the perception of English football in different countries. “What he’s done for Manchester City, I think he was a big contributor of changing the history, the mentality and the winning years that they had after that.” While one City stalwart is set to depart, another is set to renew his commitment by signing a new one-year contract. Like Aguero, influential midfielder Fernandinho had been on the verge of departing but will remain for another season after agreeing fresh terms, according to The Times. Meanwhile, Arteta insists he will be delighted for Arsenal’s fans if his team finishes above Tottenham, in the English Premier League table, but concedes the season cannot be considered a success if the club fails to qualify for Europe. The Gunners have strung four successive victories together at the tail end of a hugely underwhelming campaign, the latest of which came at Crystal Palace on Wednesday, when two late goals spoiled Roy Hodgson’s Selhurst Park farewell. – Metro
