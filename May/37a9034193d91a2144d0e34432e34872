The Herald Tadious Manyepo Sports Reporter CAPS United have received a major boost ahead of the 2021 Premiership season after securing a beverage partner, Coover Bottlers. The sponsorship package, which is worth US$90 000 over three years, was unveiled at a local hotel this afternoon. The Green Machine head of commercial and media, Raymond Gonde, said the Coover Bottling deal marks the beginning of a new commercial era at the club. “We are happy to have secured this deal,” said Gonde. “We have been negotiating with this company over the last few months and this is the result. “We have always said that sport is a business and this heralds the beginning of a new era.” Coover Bottling managing director, Faraimose Kutadzaushe, said the the sponsorship package is subject to review as soon as things stabilise. “We are very happy to partner a giant of local football like CAPS United,” he said. “This is the beginning of a long journey which I am sure will stretch for more than the three years we have agreed. “We have put in clauses in the contract which will enable us to review the package and the period. “We are not saying other partners shouldn’t come. Instead we want to see sport being run as a business.” CAPS United vice-president, Nhamo Tutisani, has always been saying the team will be run as a business and this could be the beginning of the journey.
