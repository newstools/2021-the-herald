The Herald MANCHESTER. – Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is delighted his troops are still in the race for the Champions League. This followed their 4-2 win over Manchester United, at Old Trafford, where the German coach won for the first time. “We are still in the game, still in the race. That is all we could do tonight,” said Klopp. “It was necessary. Without this result we don’t have to talk about it.” Roberto Firmino scored twice either side of half-time after Diogo Jota cancelled out Bruno Fernandes’s early opener for the home side. Marcus Rashford’s strike set up a grandstand finish, but Mohamed Salah secured a vital win in the final minute as Liverpool moved up to fifth in the table. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made 10 changes from a 2-1 defeat to Leicester on Tuesday which sealed the title for City. The Norwegian restored the majority of his regular starting line-up for United’s fourth game in seven days, but the presence of Harry Maguire was badly missed with the United captain sidelined by an ankle injury. “Of course you are going to miss him, but he’s out and we’ve got to deal with that,” said Solskjaer. “They deserved the win. We conceded goals in key moments of the game. We created our own downfall.” English Premiership Fixtures Today: Burnley v Leeds United (1:30pm); Southampton v Fulham (4pm); Brighton & Hove Albion v West Ham United (9pm).
