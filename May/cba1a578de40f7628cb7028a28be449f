The Herald MANCHESTER. — Pep Guardiola hailed “relentless” Manchester City after they clinched the “hardest” of his three English Premier League titles on Tuesday. The success sparked wild celebrations among supporters who had gathered outside the Etihad Stadium. City were handed the title when arch-rivals and nearest challengers Manchester United lost 2-1 at home to Leicester. “This has been a season and a Premier League title like no other. This was the hardest one,” said Guardiola. “We will always remember this season for the way we won. I am so proud to be the manager here and of this group of players. “They are so special. ‘’To come through this season, with all the restrictions and difficulties we’ve faced, and show the consistency we have is remarkable. ‘’It is relentless.” With coronavirus restrictions to be eased next week, there will be up to 10 000 fans in the Etihad Stadium to see City lift the trophy after their final home game with Everton on May 23. Hundreds celebrated in the streets outside City’s stadium, letting off blue flares, waving banners and joyously chanting. Since being taken over by the Abu Dhabi Group in September 2008, City have become the dominant force in English football, winning five English Premier League titles, two FA Cups and six League Cups. This is the third time City have clinched a Premier League and League Cup double, and they also won a domestic treble in 2018/19 by adding the FA Cup. — AFP.
