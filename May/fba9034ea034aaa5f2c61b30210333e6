After a period of inactivity and disruption of the previous season, it’s looking good for athletics as a number of events have been held so far in Harare and Bulawayo. The championships will feature mainly athletes from Harare but is also open to those from other provinces. The competition comes at a time when athletes are gearing up for the inter-provincial championships. However, some of the senior athletes and juniors may miss this event as they are set to compete in Zambia on Saturday and Sunday. But Amen Academy founder, Aaron Whyte, said they are optimistic of an exciting meet on Saturday. “We have a lot of talented athletes in Zim. It would have been good to have our senior athletes but i don’t see their absence affecting the quality of Competition because we have very good upcoming athletes. “Yes the event is open to all. We are one big family. We all need to rehearse for the Interprovincials on 22 May,” said Whyte. With most of the athletes in competition mode now after having had feel of the track in the past few events, Whyte said they are looking at athletes gaining more confidence as they continue progress into the season. “There are very little gains if any that should be expected within a week, however confidence levels are gained through competing so in that case yes we expect some marked improvements. By Wednesday morning they had 50 athletes registered to participate in the meet. Entries close on Thursday afternoon.
