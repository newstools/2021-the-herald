The Herald JOHANNESBURG. – The secretary-general of South Africa’s African National Congress (ANC) has refused to comply with his suspension after being charged with corruption. Ace Magashule denies the charges and said that he had instead suspended President Cyril Ramaphosa. The dispute illustrates a power struggle within the governing party. The president warned that any ANC members facing corruption charges would also face suspension if they did not leave their posts within 30 days. The ANC tougher code of conduct is being seen as a test of whether the party of Nelson Mandela is serious about ending years of corruption within government. On 30 March, Magashule was given a 30-day ultimatum to step down after being charged with embezzling public funds while he was premier of the Free State province. He refused to resign voluntarily, which resulted in the ANC suspending him. Magashule then vowed to suspend the president, but the ANC called on him to “respect” the party decision. – AFP.
