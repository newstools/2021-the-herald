The Herald Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter ALL-ROUNDER Luke Jongwe has been handed his maiden Test cap for Zimbabwe in the second Test match against Pakistan at Harare Sports Club today. Jongwe replaced opening batsman Prince Masvaure, who suffered a soft tissue injury on his hand during the first match. The 26-year old was one of the star performers for the Chevrons during the recent T20I series which they narrowly lost 1-2 to Pakistan. He was rewarded for his performances in the T20Is by being included in the Test squad as one of the five uncapped players. He would now need to translate his form to the longest version of the game. The other uncapped players for the two-match Test series included Richard Ngarava, Roy Kaia, Milton Shumba, and Tanaka Chivanga. Four of the players have featured in the series except Chivanga. Jongwe recently returned to the national team fold after a five-year hiatus. Pakistan fast bowler Tabish Khan also made his debut for the Green Shirts, at 36 years. Khan replaced Faheem Ashraf for the second Test. They lead the series 1-0 following their comprehensive victory by an innings and 116 runs in the first Test. The visitors won the toss at Harare Sports Club and have decided to bat in the second Test, with Imran Butt and Abdi Ali taking to the crease. Strict Covid-19 protocols are being adhered to during the tour. The Pakistani players received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in Harare on the eve of the second Test.
