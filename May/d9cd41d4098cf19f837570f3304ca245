GOOD times are set to roll in local rugby as the Zimbabwe Rugby Union has stepped up preparations for the resumption of the national league next month. Aaron Jani, Zimbabwe Rugby Union president, said that preparations are at an advanced stage as they have already completed the inspection of all match venues and some players are undertaking their Covid-19 vaccines. “’We have been impressed by the state of facilities and general preparedness for resumption of the sport in various provinces and teams are currently having Covid-19 tests and vaccination. “Provincial leagues are set to kick-off at the end of the month and recently we had toured around the provinces in which we were pleased with our findings on the ground. “The provinces are ready and we also gave them Covid-19 essentials to help their return to play. “Harare and Mutare leagues will start ahead of Gweru and Bulawayo as they have moved on with times in terms of preparedness and they only need a few touch-ups before the resumption this month-end,” said Jani.
