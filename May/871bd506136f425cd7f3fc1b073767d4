The Herald Victor Maphosa Herald Reporter BUS operators have hailed Government’s decision to upgrade urban roads, with dedicated bus lanes designed to ease congestion in all towns. Further, the operators through their partners, have mobilised funds which will see 250 buses being acquired and operated under the Zimbabwe United Passenger Company (ZUPCO) franchise.
Zimbabwe Passenger Transport Organisation (ZPTO) spokesperson Mr Kura Sibanda said the plan to decongest urban roads was a step in the right direction which should also be supported by an efficient public transport system. “We are happy as an association to augment and support Government plans to decongest urban roads so that citizens are able to move freely and be on time, whether they are going to work or shopping,” he said. “The biggest problem is that the volume of private vehicles getting in the city centre and coming out is congesting roads. The only solution is to put a reliable, efficient and robust mass public transport system that works on time tables and this is only sustainable if it is done centrally. It must be managed by ZUPCO. “As an organisation and working with our various partners, we managed to mobilise funding for up to 250 buses meant for urban areas and operating under the ZUPCO franchise.”
