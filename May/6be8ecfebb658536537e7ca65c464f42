The Herald NEWCASTLE. — Joe Willock scored for the sixth successive game as Newcastle United welcomed 10,000 fans back to St James’ Park by beating relegated Sheffield United 1-0 last night. The 21-year-old on-loan Arsenal midfielder headed home Jacob Murphy’s cross in front of the Gallowgate End to become the youngest-ever player to net in six straight Premier League games. Willock’s strike ensured a relatively serene reunion with supporters for Magpies boss Steve Bruce – who has come under criticism from a section of fans – a few smatterings of disquiet apart. That could have been different had David McGoldrick taken an early chance to put the visitors in front but he steered Enda Stevens’ lay-off wide from just inside the box. After that let-off, however, Allan Saint-Maximin teased and tormented the Blades back-line, playing a key part in the goal, before being substituted with what appeared a calf injury in the second half. Indeed, injuries were the only real downside for the hosts, already without top scorer Callum Wilson, as Willock also limped off to cast doubt over whether he will have the chance to extend his scoring run. — BBC Sport.
