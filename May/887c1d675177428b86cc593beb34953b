Artists can now register with the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe to access discounted medical services under a medical facility set up for them. The facility that was pioneered in Bulawayo by comedian Dumisani Ndlovu is now available in Harare, Mutare, Gweru and Gwanda, with Dr Johannes Marisa being one of the doctors on the programme. “We have been negotiating with medical practitioners, pharmacies and laboratories so that artists can access consultation services, drugs and laboratory test at discounted prices,” said Dr Marisa. “I am happy that we have found cooperating partners in Harare, Mutare, Gweru, and Gwanda.” Mr Ndlovu said the facility will also benefit their families. “To access the facilities, artists have to register for the scheme with the NACZ provincial offices in the towns,” he said. “I am happy that to date over 30 artists have registered in Bulawayo and we hope with the increased number of service providers we can have more artists coming on board to enjoy the services.”
