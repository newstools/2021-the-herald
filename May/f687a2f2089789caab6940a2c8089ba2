The Herald Rumbidzayi Zinyuke Senior Reporter Treasury has released $5 billion to the Ministry of National Housing and Social Amenities for social housing to cushion civil servants and other low income earners. The move to focus on social housing comes on the back of increased support from the private sector in housing development, which has allowed Government to restructure its housing delivery strategy. National Housing and Social Amenities Minister Daniel Garwe said the funding from Treasury would now be primarily used to finance housing for civil servants and other citizens who cannot afford to buy houses on the market. “We are receiving a lot of support from the private sector so we have now restructured our strategy in terms of the housing that is financed through Treasury. We will now focus primarily on civil servants and those citizens that are on the lower echelons of our economic structure. The private sector initiative will be to the open market for anyone who can afford it,” he said.
