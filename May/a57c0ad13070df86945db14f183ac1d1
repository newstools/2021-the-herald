The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Senior Sports Reporter TRIATHLON Zimbabwe national coach Pamela Fulton’s profile continues to grow following her appointment by World Triathlon as one of the two head coaches to lead a Junior Development Camp in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, next month. The camp, catering for athletes between the ages of 16 to 19, is running from June 5 to 10 prior to the Africa Championships to take place from June 11 to 13. Makanaka Mawere will be representing Zimbabwe at the camp in the women’s section. Triathlon Zimbabwe president, Dave Ellis, congratulated Fulton and Mawere who will be representing the country in Egypt. “A junior development camp will be held in Sharm El Sheikh from 5 – 10 June prior to the Africa Champs with places for one male and one female athletes in the 16 – 19 age-group from each African Federation to attend. “Congratulations to Pamela Fulton, who was appointed by World Triathlon as one of the two head coaches for this camp, and Makanaka Mawere, who was offered and has accepted the female slot and will be representing Zimbabwe. “In the absence of Under-19 boys representing Zimbabwe at these Africa Championships, permission from World Triathlon was sought for an Under-15 male to attend the camp but all three of our Under-15 boys declined the offer, rather waiting until they were of the appropriate age,” said Ellis. This is not the first time Fulton has been involved in such camps as last year she was one of head coaches for an ATU Under-19 Camp held in Harare. Zimbabwe are also sending a team to compete at the Africa Championships and Mawere is part of the team.
