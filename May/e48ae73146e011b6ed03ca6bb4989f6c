The Herald George Maponga in Masvingo
Sponge iron producer, Steelmakers, has applied for land to build an integrated steel-production plant in Masvingo’s industrial area, as it pulls all the stops to start iron beneficiation. Steelmakers’s subsidiary SIMBI Pvt Ltd has formally approached Masvingo City Council seeking 200 hectares of land to build a plant to beneficiate sponge iron into coal. SIMBI, which stands for Sponge Iron Mining and Beneficiation Industries, is on the verge of resuming operations having been mothballed since August 2019 on the back of a dip in global steel prices, coupled with water and power problems which increased plant inefficiency. Its plant in the Masvingo industrial area straddles 100ha and by applying for an additional 200ha, SIMBI wants to increase its land holding to accommodate the beneficiation plant. Masvingo Town Clerk Engineer Edward Mukaratirwa confirmed SIMBI’s application for the land was on his table.
Eng Mukaratirwa said the local authority will scrutinise SIMBI’s application to see if it has merit. According to the application, SIMBI wants to pour in millions of dollars in hard currency to develop an iron beneficiation plant that will produce a variety of steel products. SIMBI also postulates that the beneficiation plant will come along with a 20MW power plant for the firm to meet its power needs, with surplus fed into the national grid. Building of a beneficiation plant will not only create additional jobs in Masvingo, but will mean the firm will stop shipping sponge iron to its bigger plant in Kwekwe for further processing. Mining of iron ore at the firm’s Glenlivet concession, east of the city, has already started and council recently reconnected water supplies to enable the sponge iron plant to run again. At its peak, the sponge iron plant produced 60 000 tonnes annually and building a beneficiation plant will see SIMBI raking in more forex receipts and help grow the local economy.
