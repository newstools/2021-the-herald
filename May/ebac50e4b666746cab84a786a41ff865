The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE Table Tennis Federation will later this month host the top 16 men and women tournament at Winhood College in Windsor Park. The tournament will only cater for senior men and women categories after they got that recommendation from the Sports Commission and Government. ZTTF president, Noah Ferenando, said they are looking forward to the event as it will map the way forward as they prepare for the annual Zambia Ambassadors’ Cup. “The tournament is open to all table tennis players and will be used as a benchmark to see how well prepared are we for the upcoming international tournaments. “We are grateful that we are now able to host the top 16 national tournament after several months of ineffective. The players are eager to return to action and we expect a good turnout as it will be a selecting process for those who will represent us at the international scene. “After the Covid-19 break we are looking forward to get a medal like we did in our last attempt where we won a silver. Things may be different this time around as some countries never stopped practising but we are certain to come out with something,” said Ferenando.
