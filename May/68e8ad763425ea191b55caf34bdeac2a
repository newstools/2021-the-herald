The Herald LONDON. — English Premiership club Liverpool are hoping to offload at least eight players this summer as Jurgen Klopp begins planning for next season. The Reds headed into this past campaign with bags of optimism having clinched their first league title in 30 years. The signings of Thiago Alcantara and Diogo Jota also added strength in depth to Klopp’s title-winning squad with the Reds starting the season in good form. But injuries and poor form soon took their toll on Liverpool’s season, stopping any hope of defending their crown. An end-of-season run of going 10 games unbeaten, dropping just four points along the way, helped push them into a top-four spot on the final day of the season to seal Champions League qualification for next year. That could prove pivotal for Liverpool with the cash injection from qualifying for Europe’s elite competition expected to help them in the transfer market this summer. Ibrahima Konate looks set to be the club’s first signing with reports suggesting personal terms are already agreed. Liverpool will supposedly meet Konate’s £40 million release clause and pay it all up front. But other signings are expected with the potential of a midfielder coming in to replace Georginio Wijnaldum as well as an out-and-out striker. In order for that to happen, Liverpool may well need to raise funds from player sales. And Goal report that eight players no longer have futures at Anfield with the hope they will be moved on permanently. It is claimed that Divock Origi is set to leave with interest from several clubs around Europe. Both Harry Wilson and Marko Grujic have spent the past season out on loan at Porto and Cardiff respectively but they too are up for sale. Loris Karius has one year left on his contract at Liverpool but the club are also hoping to move him on this summer. The report adds that Liverpool will also be hoping to offload youngsters Taiwo Awoniyi, Sheyi Ojo, Ben Woodburn and Liam Millar. — The Daily Express.
