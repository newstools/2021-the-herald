The Herald Elita Chikwati Agriculture Reporter The Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (TIMB) has outlined procedures for contracting growers during the 2021/22 season to bring order in the industry, giving confidence to investors. This came as a result of increased competition among contractors, resulting in some rushing to submit long lists of growers to be contracted in the TIMB system without having shown enough proof that the growers will be fully supported. Growers enter into new contracts every season as agreements automatically lapse at the end of each marketing season when they have freedom to join schemes of their choice. In a statement, TIMB revealed that the increase in the number of contractors had resulted in stiff competition and a scramble for growers, invariably creating an unpredictable environment for genuine investors which will inevitably lead to reduced investment and collapse of the tobacco industry in the long run. “Growers previously contracted to a company who sign or renew contracts for the coming season with some company are contracted in the TIMB system without further requiring scrutiny or clarity,” said the TIMB. Independent growers (those who sold through the auction system in the previous season) previously not contracted in the prior year and have signed contracts are also contracted in the TIMB system without further requiring scrutiny or clarity. The TIMB said growers previously contracted by a different contractor should be released by the previous contractor before being contracted to the new company.
