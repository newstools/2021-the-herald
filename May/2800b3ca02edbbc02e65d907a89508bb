The Herald Conrad Mupesa Mashonaland West Bureau POLICE armoury officer-in-charge for Mashonaland West, Inspector Clive Kadambure, together with his wife, Shyness Kadambure, have been acquitted for contravening the Firearms Act. The couple was arrested in March after being linked to a case where two men were arrested in in Gonarezhou National Park. The two men were found in possession of six firearms which they were suspected of trying to smuggle to Mozambique through Sango Border Post. Chinhoyi provincial magistrate Ms Ruth Moyo acquitted the couple on Monday after a full trial which revealed that they were not linked to the Gonarezhou case. Their lawyer, Mr Fortune Murisi, confirmed the acquittal. He said there was no big deal about ammunition found at Insp Kadambure house since he worked at the armoury section of the police and in terms of Section 24 was allowed to be in possession of ammunition without having a certificate.
