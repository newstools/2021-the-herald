DESPITE being put in a tough Chibuku Super Cup group, the Premiership football new boys Whawha believe they can cause an upset when the tournament gets underway next Saturday. Coach Luke “Jukulile” Petros says his troops are ready and excited. They face former Chibuku Super Cup winners FC Platinum and 2018 winners Triangle United. The 2019 runners-up Ngezi Platinum complete the group which will be based at Mandava. Luckily for these teams, there are no stadium costs after Mandava was offered to the Premier Soccer League for free. But the former Mhangura midfielder Petros believes the league returnees can spring a surprise in this competition. “It is a challenging group. But it is good for us that we rub our shoulders with the big teams early in the season. “Our young players are excited and have declared that they are ready. They believe they can cause a surprise. “A Cup game is full of surprises,” said Petros. The former Mhangura and Lancashire Steel midfielder says he still remembers one of his major Cup games as a player. “It was the BP Cup, Dynamos versus Mhangura in 1995. “It was an exciting match, Mhangura were the underdogs, with their maiden appearance in the league. “We lost 4-0 but it was really a good game,” he said. Whawha have assembled a modest side with the bulk of players that were turning out for the club in the First Division.
Petros says the players fitness levels have improved and is likely to get to 100 percent once the round-robin matches begin. The club will unveil all their players next Tuesday in Gweru. Two winners from the group proceed to the next round. The group 4 winner meets the group 2 runners-up while group 2 winner meets runner-up group 4.
