The Herald Conrad Mupesa Mashonaland West Bureau THE Labour Court of Zimbabwe has nullified the suspension of Chegutu Rural District Council chief executive officer, Mr Dan Zvobgo and ordered his reinstatement. Mr Zvobgo was fired by the council last year in March over allegations of abuse of office and gross mismanagement. The matter was heard before the Labour Court judge, Justice Lilian Hove who, after full trial, set aside the disciplinary action. According to court papers, Mr Zvobgo was reinstated to his employment without loss of salary and benefits while the council was been ordered to pay the applicantâ€™s costs of suit. Mr Zvobgo was accused of a litany of issues including giving a non-governmental organisation, Direct Aid, a lease for Jinkstown Primary School without following proper council procedures. He was also accused of trading land deal with Croco Motors without council mandate. He was also accused of prejudicing the council by drafting and issuing a developmental permit for Sunny Fi Yeng Norton Tile Company without council mandate and in the process, the council claimed it was only US$17000 instead of 0,5 percent of their project value which was at around US$30 million.
