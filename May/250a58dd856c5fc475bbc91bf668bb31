The Herald PRETORIA. — A group of Mamelodi Sundowns fans have turned against their own team to support Al Ahly ahead of the CAF Champions League match at Lucas Moripe Stadium tomorrow. The group, which mainly compromises members of Mamelodi branches, was at Tuks Stadium on Wednesday, clad in Ahly jerseys, to cheer the arrival of former coach, Pitso Mosimane, and the Egyptian team for their training. However, the local fans’ alliance to the Red Devils does not sit very well with the Brazilians family who are accusing them of being ‘sellouts’. “How can you do that to your own club? These people are sellouts,” said Sundowns fan Freddy Mngomezulu. “We (Sundowns) are not only representing ourselves but the country. How would they dare do that?” However, Terry Mokale, who led the group of fans to meet Mosimane and Al Ahly in Pretoria, has defended their actions and spelled out that they will be supporting the Egyptian team in Atteridgeville tomorrow. — KickOff.com.
