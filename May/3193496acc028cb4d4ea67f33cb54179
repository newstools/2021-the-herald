The Herald PRETORIA. — SuperSport United coach Kaitano Tembo was full of praise for his side’s performance despite them going down 3-1 to Tshwane rivals Mamelodi Sundowns yesterday. SuperSport were run off their feet in the first half by a rampant Sundowns but showed character and fight in the second half to reduce the deficit. And, Tembo said he could not fault his players’ effort and made the claim that his side should have been 3-0 up before the Brazilians had even scored their first. “This is one game we didn’t deserve to lose,” the Matsatsantsa mentor told SuperSport TV. “The way we played. We started very well. I think before they even scored we could have been 3-0 up. “We had two good chances and the red card also didn’t do us any justice. “I should give credit to the players. They played very well. We worked very hard without the ball. “It was only in a space of ten minutes that they scored those three goals through our lapse in concentration. “Overall performance, we played very well. We just couldn’t put the ball in the back of the net. I can’t fault the players. “I told them this is one game where you need character. Players with hearts. I told them we’ve lost the first half so let’s go out there and win the second half. “And, that’s what they did. I told them we’ve got to go out there and show character and fight. “We needed a little bit of speed to break. That’s what Jones did very well. And he could track back. And Jones gave us that. “We had to move Bradley more central. It was Gabuza’s first start in close to four months. I think we played very well in the second half.” — KickOff.com
