The Herald LONDON. — Willian is keen to leave Arsenal this summer and is targeting a return to Chelsea, according to reports. The 32-year-old left Chelsea after his contract expired last June and subsequently signed a three-year deal with Arsenal on a free transfer. But since moving to north London, the Brazilian has failed to make a significant impact, scoring just once in 37 appearances this season. Willian has admitted that his preference was to extend his stay at Chelsea but the club refused to offer him a three-year deal. The midfielder is now looking to leave Arsenal this summer and Sky Sports report that Chelsea is his first-choice destination. Inter Miami have also made an approach to sign Willian, while it’s understood that Arsenal are open to offloading the Brazilian following his disappointing first season at the club. Speaking earlier this year, Willian made it clear that he was desperate not to leave Chelsea. “It was difficult to make that decision because the rivalry between the two clubs is very big,” he told UOL Esporte. “It was well thought out . . . talking to my wife and even the agent many times. “I didn’t leave the club with a fight, I left the doors open. Everyone knew the conditions, I really wanted to stay. “We ended up not finding an agreement, I ended up asking for three years, Chelsea wanted to give two, and everyone knows this story. That’s why I ended up leaving.” — Metro
