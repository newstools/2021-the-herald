The Herald JOCKEY Teaque Gould dedicated his Zimbabwe Derby win at Borrowdale Racecourse on Sunday to his friend Nooresh Juglall who passed away in Mauritius at the weekend. Gould rode Only Him to victory in The Zimbabwe Derby (Grade 3) race, coming into the straight and running for the post, in the processing giving pre-race favourite Diesel And Dust no chance to make up the deficit. The Zimbabwe Derby was run under a cloud after news broke out that former South Africa Jockey Academy graduate, and multiple Champion Apprentice, Nooresh, had died just two months short of his 30th birthday. The reigning Champion Jockey of Mauritius, Nooresh was rushed to hospital after being injured in a shocking accident on the opening day of the 2021 Mauritius Racing Season on Saturday. He grew up in Mauritius, helping his uncle water the Champs de Mars racecourse every evening from the age of 15, and eventually trained as a Workrider and Groom for two years, under Ricky Maingard. He was always determined to be a jockey and eventually found his way to the SA Jockey Academy outside of Durban. His first ride under rules was on 8 November 2009 on Subtle Beauty for Greg and Karen Anthony at Hollywoodbets Scottsville, while his very first winner was a pick-up ride on 16 March 2010 on Shine The Gold for Roy Magner at Turffontein. He made Singapore his professional home for five years, and won the first of his 217 winners in the city-state on his very first ride on Majestic Moments on 5 June 2014. He was always in the top ten on the jockey log. He called it a day in April 2019 in Singapore, citing family reasons for his wish to cut his contract. Nooresh is survived by his wife Chaaya and young family, as well as his father Satanand, his mother Kavita, his sister Sweta and younger brother Tajesh, who also trained at the SA Jockey Academy and rides on the Indian Ocean Island. â€” MTC/Sporting Post
