The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter ZAMBIA-based Cheetahs captain, Stephan Hunduza, and Germany-based wing Tafadzwa Chitokwindo, will be expected to once again lead the team at the week-long Solidarity Camp. The camp has been organised by Rugby Africa and will be held in Stellenbosch, South Africa. The pair are part of the team, which was announced on Monday, for the tri-nations tournament. Interim Cheetahs coach, Graham Kaulback, named a balanced side, made up of both the experience, and youthful players. Kaulback will take charge of the team, in the absence of head coach Daniel Hondo. The Cheetahs are set to leave for South Africa tomorrow. Hunduza and Chitokwindo headline the squad. Zimbabwe will face hosts South Africa and Uganda during the Solidarity Camp, which will run from today, until May 16. The Cheetahs will also bank on the experience of the South Africa-based duo of fullback Biselele Tshamala and Riaan O’Nell. England-based Boyd Rouse also makes a return to the side after a lengthy absence. Another notable inclusion is that of the former Zimbabwe Under-20 captain, Sam Phiri. He is a product of Falcon College and the world-renowned Western Province Rugby Institute in South Africa.
