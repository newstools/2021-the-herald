Tile and Carpet Centre has handed over the newly refurbished male surgical ward at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital in Harare, renovated at a cost of US$20 000. The 36-bed wing will result in the de-congestation of the hospital’s wards that have been catering for the extra patients. Speaking during the handover of the ward, Tile and Carpet Centre group managing director Mr Stan Mushore said the renovation of the ward was the private sector’s way of giving back to the communities and helping Government to achieve universal access to health for all. “When Covid-19 was at its peak, we thought it was prudent for us to extend a hand to this hospital as part of the programmes that we do,” he said. “Work started after we got the go ahead from the Ministry of Health and Child Care. This is our ward now; we will continue maintaining it and making sure it retains this standard.” The renovations included painting of the whole ward, tiling of the floors, bathroom repairs as well as some fittings. <img class="size-full wp-image-548473" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/Stan-Mushore-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/Stan-Mushore-1.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/Stan-Mushore-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tile and Carpet Centre managing director Mr Stan Mushore (right) and acting chief executive officer for Sally Mugabe Central Hospital Dr Christopher Pasi (left) cut the ribbon at the refurbished ward in Harare.-Picture: Memory Mangombe The hospital is one of the biggest referral centres in the country catering for millions of people from all provinces, particularly those with low disposable incomes. The hospital’s acting chief executive officer Dr Christopher Pasi said the ward catered for male patients in need of various operations for chest, intestinal and urinary problems. “This will go a long way in making sure that quality of care provided for patients is up to the expected standard,” he said. “One of the areas that Government is emphasising on is the issue of quality and this includes customer satisfaction. “It also looks at reducing issues like hospital acquired morbidity and infections. The way this ward was renovated, will assist us to achieve these goals that are part of our strategic plan.”
