The Herald MADRID. — Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone said he was grateful the ball dropped to Luis Suarez after the Uruguayan struck an 88th-minute goal in Sunday’s 2-1 win over Osasuna. The win kept his side on course to win the Spanish La Liga football title. Suarez, Atletico’s top scorer this season, had not found the net in his previous five outings, and had wasted a series of clear chances in a nerve-shredding penultimate game of the season. Atletico looked to have blown the chance to win the title when Ante Budimir gave Osasuna a shock late lead, just as nearest challengers Real Madrid went ahead against Athletic Bilbao. But, Brazilian left back Renan Lodi equalised before Suarez finally kept his cool to turn in a Yannick Carrasco pass and was then buried beneath a sea of his teammates’ bodies. “Suarez has so much experience and who better than him to resolve a game like that when it looked to be slipping away from us,” Simeone told reporters. “Suarez showed incredible spirit, he has not been scoring recently but he kept on coming close.” The Uruguayan’s goal kept Atletico two points ahead of Real Madrid and victory at Real Valladolid in their last game of the season on Sunday will hand them a first title in seven years. “Everyone tells you that suffering is part of Atletico’s identity but I didn’t think we’d suffer that much,” the Uruguayan said. “But, that is what this team is about, effort and sacrifice, many people working really hard to ensure the club achieves its objectives. Now we have to rest and prepare for the next game.”— AFP.
