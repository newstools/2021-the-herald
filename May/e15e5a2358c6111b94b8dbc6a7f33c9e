FOUR armed robbers who last week attacked and kidnapped a Harare couple who had stopped to check the condition of a dirt road, have been arrested. The incident occurred at around 8pm in Budiriro 5B when the couple was suddenly attacked by armed robbers who emerged from the darkness near a railway line in the area. The couple lost its vehicle, cash, cellphones and other valuables to the armed robbers who later dumped them near Churu Farm, not far from the area. The four suspects are Daniel Hanzi (28) of Murewa, Sasila Binda (39) of Mufakose, Stephen Chikodza (25) of Budiriro and Zephania Munyuki (34) of Zvimba. The stolen vehicle was recovered and one of the suspects was found in possession of a Revolver used to commit the offence. Criminal Investigations Department (CID) spokesperson Detective Inspector Portia Chinho confirmed the arrests and said investigations were still in progress.
