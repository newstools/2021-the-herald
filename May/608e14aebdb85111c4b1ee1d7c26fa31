The Herald LONDON. — Frank Lampard has become the fifth player to be inducted into the English Premier League’s Hall of Fame. Lampard helped Chelsea win their first-ever English Premier League football title under Jose Mourinho in 2005 and would go on to lift that same title two more times at Stamford Bridge. A prolific goalscorer from midfield, Lampard is Chelsea’s all-time leading scorer and is fifth in the English Premier League’s all-time chart. He scored 177 goals in 609 English Premier League appearances for West Ham, Chelsea and Manchester City. Lampard also managed 102 assists in that same time, picking up four English Premier League Player of the Month awards and the 2004-05 Premier League Player of the Season gong. He is widely considered as one of Chelsea’s greatest ever players and has now been recognised for his contributions in the top flight of English football. Lampard thanked his uncle, Harry Redknapp, for giving him his first big break in football before praising Claudio Ranieri and Mourinho — who he later fell out with as a manager — for their influence on him while he was at the Bridge. “There have been a lot of people that have influenced me,” Lampard said. “I guess really Harry Redknapp’s belief in me at West Ham to give me the first opportunity, Claudio Ranieri for taking me to Chelsea, and Jose Mourinho for the influence he had on me when he first arrived. However, I took things from all my managers and am thankful to them all.” — Mailonline.
