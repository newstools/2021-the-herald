The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Sevens rugby team, the Cheetahs, failed to stamp their authority at the just-ended Rugby Africa Solidarity sevens camp in Stellenbosch, South Africa. The Cheetahs managed to bag only two victories in 15 matches that were played over two weeks and they are left with just over a fortnight before they go to Monaco. Zimbabwe concluded the two-week camp with a 37-6 loss to old foes Uganda at the Solidarity camp. Rugby Africa Solidarity sevens was organised by Rugby Africa to prepare teams for Olympics and the Olympics’ qualification repechage tournament set for Monaco next month. Sunday’s defeat at the hands of Uganda was Zimbabwe’s 13th in 15 matches. Zimbabwe have already been drawn in a difficult group where they will face pacific giants, Tonga and Samoa, as well as Mexico. The Cheetahs need to top that group to stand any chance of qualifying for the Tokyo Olympics.
