The Herald Grace Chingoma Senior Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe senior womenâ€™s football team, the Mighty Warriors, were handed a fair draw in the 2022 Total Africa Women Cup of Nations qualifiers after they were drawn against Eswatini. This follows a draw conducted at CAF headquarters in Cairo, Egypt, today. A record 44 nations entered the competition and were paired according to zonal pots. Zimbabwe and other southern African region countries were placed in Pot B where there were no shocks as the COSAFA heavyweights, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe, avoided each other. Olympic Games-bound Zambia meet Malawi in the first round while South Africa will face Botswana. Zimbabwe start at home before traveling to Eswatini for the return match. Twenty-two winners will proceed to the next round where they face other teams from other regions that were paired against each other. Ten-time champions Nigeria were drawn against Ghana in their Pot F, in a game which is easily the biggest match from the first round draw.
