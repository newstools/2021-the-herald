The Herald Crime Reporter POLICE Commissioner-General Godwin Matanga has said there was a 17 percent remarkable decrease of crime cases countrywide last year as compared to 2019. He said the police service met its target of containing the growth of crime within three percent. A total of 359 513 crime cases were recorded from January 2020 to December 2020 compared to 435 579 cases recorded during the same period in 2019. “There was a remarkable decrease of 76 066 cases, thus translating to a 17 percent decrease,” said Comm-Gen Matanga. “Furthermore, a total of 30 308 road traffic accidents were recorded in 2020 compared to 37 625 reported in the same period in 2019. This depicts a 19 percent reduction in traffic accidents. “Although this might be attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic which resulted in the restrictions of movement and the conducting of business, there was a lot of effort by operational commanders in ensuring suppression of crime and road traffic accidents. “Joint foot, cycle, as well as motorised patrols involving Duty Uniform Branch, Criminal Investigations Department, Support Unit and Canine Section have continued to be carried out throughout the country.” Comm-Gen Matanga, who was addressing senior officers today, said some provinces continued to experience inland and cross border stock theft cases.
