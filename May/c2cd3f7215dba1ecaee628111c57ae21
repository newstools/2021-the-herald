The State was yesterday ordered to furnish the corruption-accused Harare Town Clerk Hoseah Chisango with a trial date on his next remand date. The instruction came from Harare regional magistrate Mr Stanford Mambanje after the State applied for a further postponement saying it was still perusing the docket. Chisango’s lawyer opposed the State’s application saying her client had so far appeared in court more than five times but no trial date has been given. She argued that the State would suffer no prejudice if her client is removed from remand as it could summons Chisango for trial when it was ready. Chisango is facing charges of criminal abuse of office or alternatively failing to prevent corruption after allegedly appointing a chief security officer, a job outside his mandate. Harare Regional magistrate Mr Stanford Mambanje ruled in the State’s favour to postpone the matter but however gave it a last chance saying if it fails to furnish Chisango with a trial date on the next remand date he would remove him from remand. Chisango is on $50 000 bail. As part of his bail conditions he was ordered not to go within 100 metres of any Harare City Council offices other than the hospital and not interfere with witnesses. If removed from remand his bail would be returned and the bail conditions fall away.
