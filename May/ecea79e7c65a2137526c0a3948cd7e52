The Herald George Maponga Masvingo Bureau Government is finalising plans to accord Rutenga Growth Point town status, in a development expected to add impetus to the growth of the urban settlement. Rutenga has been undergoing meteoric growth over the past 24 months after it’s designation as a dry port by Government. This has been precipitating an influx of investment into Rutenga, including processing companies, with two firms building marula fruit value-addition plants. Mwenezi Rural District Council chief executive Mr Albert Chivanga is upbeat about Rutenga’s growth prospects after being designated as a dry port. He disclosed that Government was already in the process of according Rutenga town status in a move that will put the growth point under the administration of a town board. If Rutenga becomes a town, it will be the third urban settlement in Masvingo after Chiredzi and Mpandawana to be accorded such status. Masvingo city remains the major commercial centre in the province.
