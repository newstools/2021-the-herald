The Herald MANCHESTER. — Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says striker Sergio Aguero is not guaranteed a Champions League final farewell because his squad selection will be “cold” and without sentiment. Aguero will leave City after 10 years when his deal expires in the summer. He faces a fitness test to play before the league season ends on Sunday. When asked if Aguero could face Chelsea in the European final on May 29, Guardiola said he will “take a decision which is the best to win”. “I would say I would be cold,” he said. “I have to be. “If Sergio is fit he is going to help us, that is for sure. If he is going to help us score goals he is going to play, but it’s the final of the Champions League.” The 32-year-old missed yesterday’s trip to Brighton — which was the penultimate game of the Premier League campaign — because of a leg injury. He missed Friday’s win against Newcastle and was substituted after 70 minutes in his last appearance for City — a 2-1 defeat by Chelsea in which he missed an attempted Panenka penalty. In an injury-hit season, the Argentine, who is being linked with a move to Chelsea and Barcelona among a host of other clubs in the summer, has scored four times in 18 appearances. He has started just eight games this term and was left on the bench when City beat Tottenham in April’s League Cup final win at Wembley. Meanwhile, Guardiola has admitted that there could be a summer clear out at the Etihad Stadium. “There are players that accept one typical situation in the team and there are other ones that don’t accept it,” Guardiola is quoted as saying in the Daily Mail. — Mailonline.
