The Herald BEIJING. — Chinese and US senior trade officials yesterday held what both sides described as “candid” discussions in their first phone call since US President Joe Biden took office, sending a positive signal that the world’s two biggest economies are restarting communication amid growing uncertainties and lingering disputes over a wide range of issues. The statements after the call also indicate that China and the US have agreed that trade is the ballast of the bilateral relationship, while also paving the way for deeper trade communications within and beyond the phase-one trade deal. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He held a phone call with US Trade Representative Katherine Tai, during which the two conducted “candid, pragmatic and constructive exchanges with an attitude of equality and mutual respect,” the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement on Thursday. “Both sides believe that the development of bilateral trade is very important, and exchanged views on each other’s issues of concern and agreed to continue to maintain communication,” read the statement. The statement did not offer any details, but its characterisation of the conversation suggests a positive vibe for the discussions, compared with the often tense atmosphere in some recent encounters between Chinese and US officials. For its part, the office of the US Trade Representative described the exchange as “candid” in a statement and said that Tai also raised some issues of concern. — Global Times.
