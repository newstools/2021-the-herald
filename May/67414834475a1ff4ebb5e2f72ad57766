The Herald Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter THEY may be rivals in the terraces when their football teams are playing against each other but Dynamos and Highlanders supporters yesterday displayed a big show of unity when they joined hands to visit music legend Zex Manatsa at his home in Harare. A statement from the official Highlanders media said their Harare Chapter branch teamed-up with their DeMbare counterparts to deliver a special gift comprising a tonne of cement to help the music legend complete his house in Mabelreign. They also presented him with football jerseys. “Yesterday the Highlanders FC Harare Chapter, together with rivals Dynamos FC visited legendary artist Zex Manatsa of the famous ‘iBhola seliphelile iHighlander iWinile’ Song and donated a tonne of cement towards the completion of his house in Malbelreign, Harare.” Manatsa is famed for churning out praise songs for the country’s big clubs, which became the rallying point for many football fans in the early days after Independence. His song Tamirireiko (Dynamos igowese) and the special dedication “Highladers song” still resonate with most of the supporters from the two clubs, more than three decades later. He also composed songs for CAPS United and Zimbabwe Saints.
