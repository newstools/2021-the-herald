The Herald NEW DELHI. – Covid-19 infections and deaths are mounting with alarming speed in India with no end in sight to the crisis and a top expert warning that the coming weeks in the country of nearly 1,4 billion people will be “horrible”. India’s official count of coronavirus cases has surpassed 20 million, nearly doubling in the past three months, while deaths officially have passed 220 000. Yesterday, the health ministry reported 357 229 new cases in the past 24 hours and 3 449 deaths from Covid-19.The country has witnessed scenes of people dying outside overwhelmed hospitals and funeral pyres lighting up the night sky. India’s top health official, Rajesh Bhushan, refused to speculate last month as to why authorities were not better prepared. But the cost is clear: People are dying because of shortages of bottled oxygen and hospital beds or because they could not get a test. – Al Jazeera.
