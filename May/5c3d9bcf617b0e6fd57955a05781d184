A MALE teacher at Chiroti Secondary School in Hurungwe district was last Friday fined $15 000 by Chinhoyi Magistrate for sending sexually offensive text messages to her married boss’ cellphone. Wilson Ganda (49), was slapped with the $15 000 fine to be paid by end of May or risk spending 45 days in prison when he pleaded guilty before Magistrate Mr Tapiwa Banda for violating Section 88 of the Posts and Telecommunications Act (Chapter 12:05) which pertains to “use of abusive language”. Lucy Luoma Dzveta (32) the complainant is employed by the Ministry of Education as a human resources manager stationed at Seven Heroes Complex in Chinhoyi. Prosecuting, Ms Odra Chitoro, told the court that Ganda started sending love messages to Dzveta in 2015 but was turned down by Gweta. Ganda is said to have continued sending the sexually offensive messages despite the advice by the complainant to stop. In April 2020, Dzveta’s husband warned the accused against abusing his wife who then apologised for the advances. Despite the warnings, the court heard that Ganda sent love and offensive text messages to Dzveta in December 2020 before being summoned and cautioned by Education Ministry authorities. Ganda is however said to have sent another message on 27 April 2021 proposing his sexual advances in which he lustfully wished to have intimate moments with Dzveta. Dzveta then filed a police report at Chemagamba Police Station, leading to the arrest of the accused.
