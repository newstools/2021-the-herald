A 32-year-old suspected armed robber who was part of a six-men gang that raided a house in Chitungwiza before robbing the occupants US$7 000 cash and a cellphone has been arrested as armed robbery cases continue to increase countrywide. The robbers first attacked a couple that was in the house while demanding cash at gunpoint. They ransacked the house before jumping into their getaway car, a silver Toyota Allion. However, some alert members of the public who heard the commotion managed to apprehend one of the suspects while the others escaped in their getaway car. Investigations are still in progress.
