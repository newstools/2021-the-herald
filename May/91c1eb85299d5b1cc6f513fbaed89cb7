ORGANISERS of the ZITF body building contest have revealed they will hold the event in July. It is held during the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair. “We are going to have the ZITF and it will be big,’’ said Simon Gama, one of the organisers. “We will observe the mandatory Covid-19 regulations and, hopefully, we will have more cooperates coming on board. “We have so far managed to engage some of our sponsors and we are only left with the main sponsor, whom I will talk to tomorrow (today).’’ Cement manufacturing company, PPC Zimbabwe, were the title sponsors in the last event. For many years, the ZITF senior men body-building show only featured men of up to 75 kilogrammes. But, this has been changed and athletes, who are over 75kgs, are now allowed to compete.
