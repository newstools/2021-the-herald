The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter HISTORY will be made tomorrow when veteran boxing promoter Stalin Mau Mau host the biggest local boxing tournament at Magamba Hall in Warren Park 1, Harare. Dubbed “The great boxing revival’’, the tournament will have 36 boxers, from different clubs, battling it out for honours. This is the first-time, in the history of Zimbabwean boxing, to have a tournament with such a huge number of boxers, taking part. Local boxers who will take part in the were urged to be punctual as they are to undergo medicals and weigh-ins early tomorrow morning. “We are encouraging boxers to be punctual as we need to have weigh-ins and medicals before the tournament. Athletes should avail themselves by 8am so that we can manage to keep up with the time. “The event is going ahead and I think it is a plus for boxers who had gone for months without action. “The youths are indulging in drug abuse because they are staying idle, hence the need for them to spend most of their time in gyms, building their bodies and engaging in professional fights,” said Mau Mau.
