The Herald Tadious Manyepo Sports Reporter THE late former Zimbabwe youth international footballer, Butler Masango, didn’t grow up in his rural home of Chiweshe. He was raised in Chitungwiza. Most villagers, who thronged the Masango homestead in Mupandenyama Village in Chiweshe, for his burial on Sunday, didn’t quite know him. Yet, he was their role model.

There are so many stars who were developed by Masango. “He was a hero this side.
