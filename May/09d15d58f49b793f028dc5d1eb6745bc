GOVERNMENT says it values the independence of the judiciary to interpret the law as in the case of the legal dispute over the extension of retired Chief Justice Luke Malaba’s service with another five years. Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs secretary Mrs Virginia Mabhiza said Government esteemed the principles of the separation of powers as set out in the Constitution of Zimbabwe, contrary to negative reports claiming that the authorities were interfering with the judiciary in a bid to take power away from the courts. This followed the Government’s disagreement with the High Court judgment annulling the extension of retired Chief Justice Luke Malaba’s service beyond the age of 70. “The Government of Zimbabwe therefore recognises the importance of the judiciary as a dependable interpreter of the law where various opinions may arise,” said Mrs Mabhiza in statement. Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi and Attorney General Advocate Prince Machaya on Monday separately filed their notices of appeal against an urgent High Court judgment made on Saturday, as the legal contest spilled into the Supreme Court.
