The Herald TURIN. — Cristiano Ronaldo is set for fresh talks about his future with Juventus this summer. Ronaldo said he has realised one of the goals he set for himself when he joined Juventus in 2018 and valued everything the club had achieved this season despite their run of nine straight Italian Serie A title coming to an end. Ronaldo (36) has one year remaining on his contract at Juventus, but there has been a flurry of media speculation that the Portuguese forward could be leaving in the summer if they missed out on qualifying for the Champions League. Juventus were deposed as champions by Inter Milan and only climbed into the top four on the final day of the campaign on Sunday to secure Champions League qualification. Juventus finished fourth in the Italian Serie A on Sunday night, after they beat Bologna 4-1 and Napoli dropped points with a 1-1 draw against Verona. He wrote on Instagram on Monday: “This year we couldn’t win Serie A, congratulations to Inter for the well deserved title. However, I have to value everything that we achieved this season at Juventus, both in collective and individual terms. “The Italian Super Cup, the Italian Cup and the Serie A top scorer trophy fill me with happiness, mainly due to the difficulty they carry with them, in a country where nothing is easy to win. “With these achievements, I reached a goal that I had set myself since the first day I arrived in Italy: to win the Championship, the Cup and the Super Cup, and also to be Best Player and Top Scorer in this great football country filled with tremendous players, giant clubs and a very own football culture. “Thanks to everyone who took part in this journey! We stand together!” The club declined to comment on the post. Despite not playing in the final game, Ronaldo secured Serie A’s top scorer award with 29 goals in 33 appearances, finishing in front of Inter striker Romelu Lukaku, who ended on 24 goals. — Sky Sports.
