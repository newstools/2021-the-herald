The Zimbabwe Republic Police has expressed concern over an increase in armed robbery cases in which criminals are targeting people either walking on the streets or businesspeople keeping large amounts of cash countrywide. Police have since declared war on criminals involved in such cases. Most of these criminals who are masterminding armed robbery cases countrywide are those that were recently released from jail on bail pending appeal and have been evading arrest. In a statement, national police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said the police will remain firm on the ground to ensure that peace prevails countrywide. “The ZRP is warning criminals targeting people on the streets and other parts of the country that their day in court will surely come,” he said. His sentiments come after police, on Sunday, arrested three suspected armed robbers, Vincent Chasara (26), Admire Mushamba (23) and Mudadirwa Chamunorwa (age not given) in connection with a robbery case that occurred in Stoneridge Park.
