The Herald LIVERPOOL. — Everton kept alive their hopes of playing European football next season as Richarlison’s header gave the Toffees a 1-0 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers in front of their own fans at Goodison Park last night. After a goalless first half, Richarlison rose highest to power home a header early in the second half. The Brazilian had been the home side’s most dangerous player, having forced a good save out of John Ruddy in the first half before firing wide from close range. Adama Traore went closest to scoring for Wolves but his powerful first-half drive was tipped over superbly by Jordan Pickford. The Everton goalkeeper had also done well to keep out a Morgan Gibbs-White volley as the visitors had the better of the opening 45 minutes. But, that was as close as Wolves got as Everton instead finished the game strongest with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Richarlison both going close to adding to the scoreline. The victory ensured the Toffees finished a disappointing home campaign on a high and means they go into the final round of Premier League fixtures this weekend with a chance of a top-seven finish. There were 6,500 Toffees spectators back in the stands for the visit of Wolves and their return certainly gave the home side that extra bit of spark that has often been lacking. There were times when familiar bad habits slipped through, particularly in the first half as they often lacked quality in the final third. — BBC Sport
