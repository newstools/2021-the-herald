While it may take at least three sittings for some people to achieve the basic five Ordinary Level subjects including Mathematics, Science and English, it is not so for others. There are people who have never experienced how it feels to come  second or third in class in their entire academic lives. Tadiwanashe Ryan Emmanuel Mavetera, a 17-year-old learner at Ruya Adventist High School in Mt Darwin is among those people. After having scooped 4 units at Grade 7, he has done it again. This time around he defied the odds by attaining 20 A’s at Ordinary Level and has already decided his future which is to study nuclear and quantum physics then start a business related to quantum technology. Even the Covid-19 induced national lockdown that saw the temporary closure of schools could not stop him from excelling,neither did the humble background have a say in his destiny. “During the Covid-19 lockdown I managed to concentrate through sheer determination knowing that we were writing that year so I kept focusing on my studies. I cut off some entertainment luxuries and kept them at a minimum during lockdown in order to maximise my study time,” he said. If we are to go by the statistics, Tadiwanashe deserves to stand shoulder to shoulder with the country’s all time Zimbabwe School Examinations Council ordinary level brightest learners. Even the late Henry Fischel, the man credited for having probably invented examinations would be surprised by this feat. Our news crew tracked the whiz kid born in a family of two, who narrated the secret behind his road to success. The whiz kid attributed his success to God. “I can’t say I was born great. I believe that I was blessed because the first prayer my parents taught me said “Mwari ndokumbirawo njere. (God grant me wisdom)”. “I believe the source was God who answered my prayer as well as the effort that I put in because hard work plus divine intervention equals success,” he said. The genius said while intellect was part of his family, his parents and friends gave all the necessary support. “My family members rooted for me. I had my friends the likes of Biggy Chikambwe, Takunda Muchenge and more. Truth be told the 20 A’s have me absolutely overwhelmed, words cannot simply begin to express the extent of my happiness,” he said. Tadiwanashe said he was a religious follower of his  study timetable which started at 10 am after doing chores and in the evening after dinner ,where he would also study till 11pm and at times stretching till midnight. “I couldn’t go for extra lessons during the lockdown because of the financial stress Covid-19 brought so instead I had to teach myself several subjects such as additional mathematics, business enterprise skills and commerce,” he said. Tadiwanashe said school teachers were very supportive and assisted whenever he needed help as they would take time out of their busy schedules to help. “When I was at school the likes of Ms Ncube helped me with Sociology, Mr Marume assisted with Building and Mrs Bhodheni helped me with Family and Religious Studies. <img class="size-full wp-image-546383" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/0705-1-1-UNNAMED-23.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/0705-1-1-UNNAMED-23.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/0705-1-1-UNNAMED-23-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tadiwanashe Ryan Emmanuel “My school was very supportive of me and helped to provide a very conducive environment to study for the exams. ‘‘I would follow the syllabus and look for learning material on the internet,” he said. The genius said success had now become part of his routine life. “Since grade 1 my academic scores have been high. I was number 1 from grade 1 to grade 5. This all happened when I was still learning in South Africa at Hamilton Primary school. “I transferred to Zimbabwe in Grade 6 and during that time ,I faced challenges due to Shona and General Paper which was very different from what I did in South Africa, but still I managed to get four units,” he said. The whiz kid said he got a lot of help and support from Ralph Junior school in Zimbabwe which became his solid foundation. “At Ruya Adventist High school since Form 1, I was always the overall best student in my stream every single term. “During prize giving I would always be the highest in more than five subjects.” He paid tribute to the school Chaplin Pastor Utete who gave him spiritual advice.
