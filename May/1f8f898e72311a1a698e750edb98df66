The Herald THE Global Esports Games, held each year in December, will convene the world in a celebration of esports, virtual sport, music and entertainment. The GEG will feature teams from across the world participating in multi-title esports competitions and active esports.
In parallel, GEFcon, a global convention of thought leaders, and the GEFestival, a dynamic celebration of inclusive esports culture highlighting music, art, technology, fashion, food and much more, promise to add to the diverse, immersive and world-class programme. “The first Global Esports Games to be held in December this year will provide the opportunity to showcase esports to the world”, said Ng Chong Geng, President, Singapore Esports Association (SGEA). “We are grateful to have the opportunity to host this truly historic event”.
Co-Chairs of the Coordination Commission for the Global Esports Games, Angela Ruggiero and Luzeng Song, noted that appointing the right host cities is a key to success. “We will lend our support and guidance so the host cities can unleash their full potential,” Ruggiero said, “and so the incredible untold stories of the power of esports – and sport as the future of entertainment – can be unlocked, too.” Paul J. Foster, Chief Executive Officer, Global Esports Federation, said the energy, skill and passion of esports, and the technologies that drive it, are captured in the GEF motto: #worldconnected. Carrying that forward to the Global Esports Games, he said, “We have listened to the athletes and players, the incredible publishers and developers, and the wider community to create a platform for athletes to shine, representing countries and territories as in other prestigious multi-sport competitions.” – www.globalesports.org
