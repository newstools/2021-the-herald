The Herald TURIN. — Cristiano Ronaldo has helped Juventus unveil their new kit for 2021-2022 season despite ongoing speculation over his future at the club. The striker was seen wearing the club’s iconic black-and-white stripes in a series of photographs released on the club’s website. The launch comes just after Ronaldo’s super cars were seen being loaded onto a truck of a well-known Portuguese moving company headed to Lisbon. Italian publication Tuttosport published a video — that was posted on the web by Per Semper Calcio — which saw a group of men loading seven cars onto a Rodo Cargo haulage vehicle at 3 o’clock in the morning. The company chosen for the move is a well-known transport company based in Lisbon — suggesting Ronaldo is taking his supercars back to his homeland, while deciding on what comes next for his football career. Despite Ronaldo’s decision to send his cars back to Lisbon, Jorge Mendes has ruled out a fairytale return to his former club Sporting Lisbon as he claims the striker’s “career plans do not go through Portugal.” Ronaldo has been linked with a transfer this summer after Juventus missed out on the Serie A title for the first time in a decade this season. The Italian giants also crashed out of this season’s Champions League at the last-16 stage and could fail to finish the domestic season in the top four. However, Ronaldo’s inclusion in the club’s unveiling of the new kit has thrown a further spanner in the works. — Mailonline.
