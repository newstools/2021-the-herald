The Herald LONDON. — When we hear the name of Rafael Nadal, Roland Garros is the next thing that comes to mind. The success that the Spanish has had for more than a decade in the French capital is amazing. His hunger and his desire to win the French Open tennis tournament repeatedly are commendable. There have been no players who have come close to threatening Rafa’s legacy at the French Open. Nadal recently spoke about the next big tournament of the calendar season. The second Grand Slam event of the year is about to start, on May 30 onwards. Like every year, the supreme Spanish athlete is ready to lift the crown once again. The 34-year-old spoke about his chances of lifting the title for the 14th time, a record, and stated: “Right now the truth is that, as always, Roland Garros is a very important tournament for everyone. And, in this case, for me, it is the most important tournament of my career, without a doubt. The only thing I’m focusing on right now is trying to do my best, right? Later, we’ll see what I’m capable of.” It is understandable that Rafa does not want to be distracted from his preparations. He wants to focus and work hard in training sessions to help him reprise his heroics on the spot. Moving on to Nadal’s season so far, he started in Australia and competed in the Australian Open. Unfortunately, his route was cut short in the quarter-finals, after which he took a break and returned for the clay court events. After resuming his season, he participated in the Monte Carlo Masters. Although he lost in the early stages, he recovered and captured his twelfth title in Barcelona. — TennisNews.com
