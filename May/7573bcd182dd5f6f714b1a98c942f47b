The trial of land developer Georgios Katsimberis, accused of duping Pokugara Properties (Pvt) Limited of close to US$1 million in a joint venture to build cluster houses in Harare’s Borrowdale suburb, hit another delay after the presiding magistrate postponed the fraud case yet again. Pokugara Properties, a company into property developing, has since complained to the Prosecutor General’s Office accusing the Special Anti-Corruption Unit and lawyer Mr Tendai Biti of colluding to delay and eventually stop the prosecution of Katsimberis, who is accused of fraud. Pokugara Properities wrote a letter of complaint to Prosecutor General Mr Kumbirai Hodzi after the company received correspondence through court records indicating communication between the three parties. In a letter addressed to Mr Hodzi on April 21, Mr Simbarashe Kadye, who is representing Pokugara Properties accused Mr Biti and some officials from SACU of delaying the process to prevent justice from taking place. He said this was being done through giving many excuses to start the trial. Katsimberis is being accused of obtaining fake house plans that he used to construct a show house on Pokugara Properties land in Borrowdale. “We wish to formally record our displeasure in the manner in which this matter is being handled,” wrote Mr Kadye. “The trial of this matter was supposed to begin on April 15 (after more than five postponements going back a year). The matter has on April 30 been postponed again.”
