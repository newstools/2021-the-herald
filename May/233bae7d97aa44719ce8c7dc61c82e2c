The Herald George Maponga in Masvingo Zanu PF is gearing for both parliamentary and local authorities’ by-elections in Masvingo by holding primary elections to select its candidates and ensure that the party is not caught flat-footed when the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission lifts the Covid-19-induced moratorium on polls. In Masvingo Urban, the revolutionary party will tomorrow hold primaries to choose candidates in Wards 4 and 7. The two wards are vacant following the recalling of Messers Richard Musekiwa (Ward 7) and Godfrey Kurauone (Ward 4) who were under the MDC Alliance banner. They recalled by MDC-T leader Mr Douglas Mwonzora. The ruling party waived primaries in Masvingo Urban’s Wards 3 and 5 after Cdes Taurai Mudzviti and Hakiseone Chimwani were unopposed in the two wards respectively. Provincial political commissar Cde Jevas Masosota said his party wanted to make sure it’s candidates get enough time to campaign. He said the primaries were being held in compliance with Covid-19 rules and regulations. Besides Masvingo City, the ruling party has already held primaries to choose its candidates for the vacant Ward 21 in Bikita, Wards 9 and 16 in Chiredzi. For parliamentary by-elections, Zanu PF held primaries in Chivi South and Mwenezi East where Cdes Munyaradzi Zizhou and Master Makope were elected respectively.
