The Herald Tadious Manyepo Sports Reporter HARARE City and Yadah have played a goalless draw in the Chibuku Super Cup tie at the National Sports Stadium this afternoon. That means both teams have failed to win in their opening three matches. Harare City have drawn all their games while Yadah have drawn twice and lost once against Dynamos. The Municipality side had the better of exchanges throughout the tie but missed a glut of clear chances including a penalty in the first half. Maxwell Nyamupangedenguâ€™s penalty was saved by Panashe Nyabunga after William Manondo had been fouled inside the box. Winger Emmanuel Mandiranga was also guilty of missing several chances including a sitter ten minutes from time. Yadah had their own opportunities but at the end the match fizzled to a dull draw.
