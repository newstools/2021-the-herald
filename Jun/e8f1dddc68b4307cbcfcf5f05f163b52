The Herald Fungai Lupande Mashonaland Central Bureau Resettled farmers at Bradjule Farm, located west of ward 26 in Mazowe District, had no access to safe water for decades and the enabling environment created by the Second Republic has allowed Direct Aid to come to the rescue of this community. The farmers were resettled at this farm in 2001 and the tap water system was vandalized, leaving the community relying on shallow wells for drinking water. Fearing an outbreak of communicable diseases like cholera, ward 26 councillor Alderman Mazhambe approached Direct Aid for assistance. “The Second Republic’s thrust is leaving no one behind and as leaders, we are required to listen to people,” he said.  “After seeing the plight of the people, I approached Mr Muhammad at Direct Aid for assistance. “The development happening in communities since the coming in of the second republic is in line with the National Development Strategy 1, devolution and Vision 2030. It is my hope that by 2025 all farms in ward 26 rural must have boreholes and tap water.” Village development coordinator Mr Wonder Mandizha thanked Mr Mazhambe and Direct Aid for bringing relief to Bradjule Farm. He said the community now had a safe drinking water source close to homes. Deputy Director at Direct Aid, Mr Hamard Hamad, thanked Government for providing the enabling environment.
