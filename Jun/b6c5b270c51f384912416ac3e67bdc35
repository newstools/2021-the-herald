The Herald LONDON — UEFA have handed Austrian forward Marko Arnautovic a suspension following his outburst at Leeds United and North Macedonia player Gjanni Alioski at Euro 2020. Arnautovic has received a one-match ban following the UEFA Appeals Body’s verdict yesterday afternoon. Austria and North Macedonia played out a heated contest in Sunday’s Group C opener in Bucharest. Arnautovic came off the bench and scored Austria’s third goal in the 89th minute to secure a comfortable 3-1 triumph. However, it was his celebration that followed that unsurprisingly made headlines and has resulted in this ban. The former West Ham United star allegedly aimed an anti-Albanian insult towards Egzon Bejtulai, who is of that background. Leeds’ Alioski came to his North Macedonia team-mate’s defence, leading to a fiery showdown with Arnautovic as full-time approached. Whilst Alioski, has an Albanian background, Arnautovic is of Serbian heritage, which could be the source of the incident. — The Daily Express.
