The Herald Senior Court Reporter RUBAYA and Chatambudza Law firm has written a letter of complaint to the Law Society of Zimbabwe against a Harare lawyer Liberty Mandiveyi, whom it is accusing of practicing under its name despite having left the institution two years ago. In a letter written to the LSZ by Mr Everson Chatambudza, the law firm said Mandiveyi was handed to the police at Chegutu Magistrates Court after he failed to produce a practicing certificate after appearing in court under the banner of Rubaya and Chatambudza Law firm. “By copy of this letter we are informing the Judicial Service Commission and ZRP to be on the lookout for this individual for he may commit criminal acts on the false basis of being employed by us thereby prejudicing us as well as unsuspecting members of the public,” reads the letter. The law firm said any legal work done by Mandiveyi since November was not done for and on their behalf and accept no responsibility for such acts or dealings done by him.
