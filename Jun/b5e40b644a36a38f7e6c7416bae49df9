The Herald SAINT PETERSBURG. — Sweden topped Group E and sent Poland home from the European Championship with a stoppage time winner to make it 3-2 in one of the tournament’s most exciting games. Sweden appeared to be cruising after Emil Forsberg scored the second fastest goal in Euros’ history a mere 82 seconds in, followed by a second-half breakaway strike. But, Poland’s Robert Lewandowski, who hit the bar twice in the first half, narrowed Sweden’s lead two minutes later with a curling shot from outside the edge of the penalty area, then got a second in the 84th minute to set up a thrilling finale. Viktor Claesson got Sweden’s winner in stoppage time. In the knockout stage, Sweden will face one of the third-placed sides in Glasgow on June 29. Spain, who beat Slovakia 5-0 in the other Group E game to come second, will meet Croatia in Copenhagen on June 28. Poland scored more than once in a match at the European Championships for the very first time, in what was their 14th match in the competition. Sweden have won 10 of their last 12 matches against Poland (D1 L1), including each of the last six in a row. Poland have won just one of their last 10 matches across all competitions (D4 L5), going six games without a win (D3 L3) —their longest such run since September to November 2018 (six games). Scored after just 81 seconds, Emil Forsberg’s opener for Sweden against Poland was the second-fastest goal ever scored from the start of a European Championship match, after Dmitry Kirichenko for Russia v Greece in 2004 (65 seconds). Sweden’s Emil Forsberg has scored in consecutive major tournament apps (Euros/World Cups), after scoring in just one of his previous nine. Forsberg has netted three goals from three shots on target at EURO 2020. — Reuters.
