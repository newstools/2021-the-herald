The Herald Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE got their campaign at the Billie Jean King Cup Europe/ Africa Group III on a losing note after going down 1-2 to Algeria at SEB Arena in Vilnius, Lithuania, yesterday. It was their first tie in Pool E that also features Malta and Kenya. Tadiwanashe Mauchi lost 2-6, 2-6 to Ines Bekrar in the first match of the tie before Tanyaradzwa Midzi beat Lynda Benkaddour 6-2, 6-4 in the second singles match. But, her efforts were not enough as Mauchi and Midzi went on to lose 2-6, 0-6 against the pair of Ines Bekrar and Ines Ibbou in the doubles. They are now set to take on Malta and Kenya in the remaining two ties, in their group. The competition is featuring 21 countries, grouped into six pools, competing in a round-robin format. The winners from the six pools will then meet in the play-offs draw to determine the two teams which will be promoted into Group II. After a 12-year absence from the competition, Zimbabwe are probably looking at making their first steps, towards building a team, which will constantly compete at this level and also challenge for promotion, going into the future. The team is being led by captain Fadzai Mawisire. Speaking to The Herald, ahead of the competition, Tennis Zimbabwe manager Cliff Nhokwara, said the country’s return to the event was a positive move for junior girls as they now have something to look forward to. “It shows to all the girls playing tennis in the country, there is something to look forward to, representing the nation at that level. “Obviously, when you participate at that level you can decide how your tennis will be, whether it’s for college purposes, or turning professional. “This is a platform to assist in making those decisions,” said Nhokwara. The competition is running until Saturday.
