The Herald Conrad Mupesa Mashonaland West Bureau A CHINHOYI magistrate recently sentenced two men to nine years’ imprisonment for one count of attempted murder charge. Liberty Kunorozva and John Obert Mavezere both (22) were found guilty when they appeared before Chinhoyi regional magistrate Mr Ignatius Mugova. They had pleaded not guilty to the charge of seriously assaulting Praise Gwapedza (25) but were sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment after a full trial. Three years were suspended on good behaviour. The duo will serve an effective six years in prison. Prosecutor Mr Nyasha Sibesha told the court that on July 23 last year at D Troop Mine in Chikuti, the complainant Gwapedza of Chikonohono, Chinhoyi, was assaulted on his way from the mine. The two were in the company of Prince Anani and Nkosilati Makali who are still at large. The quartet assaulted Gwapedza with open hands and booted feet. Anani, the court heard, took a stone which he used to hit the complainant’s head several times while Mavezere used a broken bottle to stab him once on the ribs and the right eye and became temporarily blind. The four vagrants indiscriminately assaulted the complainant and left him for dead, fortunately Gwapedza was rescued later.
