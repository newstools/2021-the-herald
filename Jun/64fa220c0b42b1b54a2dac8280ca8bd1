A Chegutu farmer who rammed drums that barricade the road at State House during the night was fined $30 000 for negligent driving. Robert Harold Paterson (39), who was believed to be drunk on the day in question, also risks being jailed for 20 days if he fails to pay the fine. Paterson was convicted after trial when he appeared before Harare magistrate Mrs Barbra Chimboza. Paterson rammed into the drums on May 5 this year at around 8pm. Miss Caroline Mutimusakwa prosecuted.
