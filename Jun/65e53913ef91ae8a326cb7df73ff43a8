AFTER successfully hosting two International Tennis Federations 18-and-Under tournaments in Bulawayo, Tennis Zimbabwe are looking at hosting more international tournaments to allow more juniors to compete at that level. The just-ended J5 Bulawayo Cranrid ITF South Central Zim Leg 2 18-and-Under tournament was won by South Africa’s Andreas Scott and Suzanie Pretorius in the boys and girls singles respectively. The pair dominated the first event as well that ran from May 31 to June 5. Speaking after the second tournament, Nhokwara emphasised the need for local players to remain active at an international level and the importance of bringing more tournaments into the country. He also pointed out they resumed competition a bit late compared to their counterparts in other countries.
“It’s a combination of both (competing outside the country and hosting events). But ultimately our players need to play more international events. “Obviously South Africa’s calendar is much stronger than us, their provinces are stronger than us. They resumed tennis earlier than us and hosted ITF events where some of our players tried to go. While we started in March but just trainings with no tournaments. “We had eight people in the quarterfinals, we should have easily had a Zimbabwean in the final. “We need more tournaments, more ITF tournaments,” said Nhokwara. TZ have engaged ITF to host more junior tournaments in the country.
