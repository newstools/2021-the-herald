The Herald Victor Maphosa-Herald Reporter A four-year-old boy died after he was hit by a bus along Herbert Chitepo Avenue in Harare yesterday while a tout was fatally stabbed near Simon Vengai Muzenda bus terminus in a dispute over passengers. The boy was left in a car by his mother when she went into a funeral parlour, but was hit by the bus when he attempted to follow her, said national police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi. “He died instantly. Police are now conducting investigations. It is a sad incident. Parents must not leave children unattended,” he said. In the tout case, police are now hunting the killers of Patrick Mudiwe, a tout. Mudiwe was popularly known as Kedha and his injured colleague was identified as Jasper Maoneke. The deadly clash was sparked off when touts who are said to belong to Bolt Cutter and CAG buses, were fighting. Mr Maoneke was rushed to Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals where he was reportedly battling for his life. Allegations are that Mr Mudiwe, who reports said helped load Bolt Cutter buses, had a scuffle with a tout identified only as Tinashe, who reportedly helped load CAG buses. It is said as the scuffle ensued, a white Nissan Hardbody with concealed number plates arrived with a gang of up to 10 people who started assaulting Mudiwe. Asst Comm Nyathi said while the 10 people in the Nissan Hardbody were assaulting Muduwe, reports are that he managed to escape and ran away. He said as soon as Mr Mudiwe was stabbed and died, the suspects rushed back into their vehicle and sped off. He warned bus operators to stop employing touts.
