VETERAN sports administrator Anna Mguni is now the World Rowing development consultant after she stepped down as the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee chief executive. Mguni worked for the ZOC holding various positions before she became the chief executive in 2011 until last year when she was replaced by Stephen Mudawarima. World Rowing (FISA) is the international governing body of the sport of rowing. It is empowered by its 156-member National Rowing Federations, the National Olympic Committees and the International Olympic Committee to govern the sport of rowing. FISA sets the rules and regulations for the practice of the sport, in all its forms and organises sanctioned World Rowing events. It also provides advice and expertise for the organisation of rowing regattas, on coaching education and other matters relating to the sport and its development. Mguniâ€™s role will be to promote the standards of rowing, especially in developing nations.
