The Herald Thupeyo Muleya Beitbridge Bureau A Beitbridge man who was on the police wanted list for raping a teenager, has been jailed for six months after police found him with an unlicensed gun. Felix Zinyama of Dulivhadzimu suburb is alleged to have raped the juvenile in a bushy area at knife point on January 14 before going into hiding for four days. Police on patrol raided the house where he was hiding and stumbled upon an unregistered firearm belonging to the suspected rapist. While police investigations into the rape case were still in progress, Zinyama was last week taken to court for illegal possession of a firearm where he was jailed six months. He was convicted on his own plea of guilty to contravening a section of the Firearm Control Act when he appeared before Beitbridge resident magistrate Mr Takudzwa Gwazemba. The firearm has since been confiscated by the State and Zinyama is expected to appear in court soon for another charge of rape. Prosecutor Mr Ronald Mugwagwa said Zinyama was reported for raping the juvenile on January 14 before going into hiding. The court heard that Zinyama and the complainant stay in the same neighbourhood and on the day in question, he saw her in the bush. He then called the girl and walked her to a secluded area where he raped her once at knife point. After committing the offence, Zinyama disappeared for four days. The state further alleges that the accused ran out of luck on January 18, when some police officers on patrol duties in the Dulivhadzimu suburb received a tip-off concerning his hiding place. They then pounced on the identified house, where they found him asleep and effected an arrest. The police officers also searched his room leading to the discovery of the unlicensed Star pistol which had an empty magazine.
