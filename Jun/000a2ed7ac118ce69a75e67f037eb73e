The Herald Victor Maphosa Herald Reporter POLICE have arrested a woman in Epworth after she allegedly stole an infant from Epworth Local Board Clinic yesterday.  Josie Muzimbe reportedly sneaked into the clinic ward where she took advantage of the infant’s mother who had fallen asleep and stole the baby girl from her.
