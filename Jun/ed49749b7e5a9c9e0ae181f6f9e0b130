SOUTH Africa A continued with their dominance of hosts Zimbabwe A after they claimed an innings and 166-runs win in the first unofficial test match at Harare Sports Club this afternoon. The hosts batted awfully on the last day and were bowled out for 93 runs in their second innings. This was a marked breakdown in comparison to their first innings score of 344 runs. The South Africans, in response, totally subjugated the home bowlers and had declared on 603/4 on the third day. Records tumbled on the same day as the visiting captain Zubayr Hamza (222*) and Sinethemba Qeshile (124*) notched up career-best scores. There was also another century from Ryan Rickelton (109) and Eddie Moore narrowly missed on his first class century after falling for 93.
But Zimbabwe still looked able to salvage something from the match despite South Africa taking a 259-run lead going into the final session on Day three. The hosts, however, lost two wickets early and were on 22/2 at stumps on Day three. They lost opener Brian Mudzinganyama (8) and number three batsman, Wesley Madhevere (0). They ran into more troubles on the final day when eight wickets tumbled just for 71 runs. Daryn Dupavillon was a constant performer with the ball for South Africa A. He picked up eight match wickets on the bowling front, as the visitors claimed a big victory. The final four-day game will get underway this Sunday at the same venue.
