ZIMBABWEAN football players at Nkana were relieved of some pressure after they managed a draw against Zanaco in the Zambia Super League during the week. The point earned eased some pressure for the last year’s champions, who now require a point from their remaining two league games.
They host Buildcon tomorrow afternoon. Warriors’ goalkeeper Talbert Shumba, midfielder Tichaona Chipunza and defenders Kelvin Moyo, Jimmy Dzingai and Takudzwa Chimwemwe are on the books of Nkana. And it has not been easy defending the league for Nkana who found themselves in trouble after fulfilling the Champions League commitments. It has been a tough time for Nkana with the results not coming. Last weekend they lost 3-2 to Young Green Eagles. Thabani Kamusoko and Tafadzwa Dube’s club Zesco United were last week crowned the Zambian champions with three games to spare.
The Zambian league will conclude on June 27. The Zimbabwean players plying their trade in the neighbouring league are some of the players that Warriors coach Zdravko Logarusic will be counting on when he picks his COSAFA squad. The local league has been indefinitely suspended following its resumption in May.
