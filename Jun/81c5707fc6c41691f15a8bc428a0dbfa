The Herald JOHANNESBURG — Willard Katsande has equalled countryman Tinashe Nengomasha’s record for the most appearances by a foreign player in Kaizer Chiefs’ history. Katsande (35), played a starring role for Chiefs on Saturday as the Soweto giants secured their first-ever spot in the CAF Champions League final, following a 1-0 aggregate victory over Morocco’s Wydad Casablanca. The Zimbabwe international made his 325th appearance for the Amakhosi across all competitions, equalling Nengomasha’s record for the most matches by a non-South African player for the club. Katsande appears poised to claim the record outright when the Glamour Boys meet Pitso Mosimane’s Al Ahly in the final of the Champions League next month. He will also be hoping to help his side claim a first-ever triumph at the continent’s showpiece club competition. The veteran midfielder joined Chiefs from Ajax Cape Town in 2011 and has been a regular fixture for the club over the last decade, helping his side win two league titles and a trophy in each of the Nedbank and MTN 8 thus far. He was not the only player to achieve a special milestone during Saturday’s clash against Wydad as teammate Njabulo Blom also celebrated the occasion of his 50th appearance in the famous gold and black strip at the FNB Stadium. —KickOff.com.
