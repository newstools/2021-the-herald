The Herald Crime Reporter A 26-year-old woman was over the weekend drugged with an unknown substance and become unconscious before being raped for several hours by a self-styled prophet in the bush along new Chitungwiza Road in southern Harare. The woman was found dumped on the side of the road by a passerby who helped her to make a report to the police. The woman had gone to see a prophet only identified as Madzibaba Tichaona for assistance. She paid the US$20 for the consultation and was then given an unknown substance in a clay pot to drink. She fell unconscious. She was then raped several times before being dumped by the road side, national police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said yesterday. Police have since launched a manhunt for the prophet identified asÂ  Madzibaba Tichaona. Police are also hunting a self-styled Harare prophet who allegedly raped an Old Highfield woman after he claimed that she was possessed with an evil spirit and he had been sent by the Holy Spirit to cleanse her. The prophet identified only as Madzibaba Ray of Johane Masowe YeChishanu Nyeredzi-Nomwe went on to rape the 30-year-old woman. Last month, a self-styled prophet was arrested in Budiriro on allegations of raping a 25-year-old woman while threatening her with a snake.
