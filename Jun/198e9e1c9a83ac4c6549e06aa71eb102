PREMIERSHIP side Chicken Inn are mobilising other clubs through social media to rally the Government to allow them to continue playing football. This follows the decision to ban all sporting activities amid Covid-19 rising cases in the country. On Sunday night, the Sports Commission affected the Government’s position by suspending sport with immediate effect. In a statement, the Sports Commission said all sporting activities have been banned indefinitely. “All sporting activities and events are hereby suspended with effect from Monday 14 June 2021 until further notice. “All national sports associations, clubs, gyms, and related stakeholders should abide by this suspension without exception. “The Sports Commission is well aware of certain ongoing, or contemplated, national sports commitments (including qualifiers for international events) and will be in urgent direct communication with the relevant national associations thereof on guidance, and other mitigatory measures, in light of the above suspension,” reads the statement. In response, Chicken Inn wrote on their Twitter page yesterday: “In our differences, we are one. Let’s come together to let the powers that be know that we have done well. We test every weekend and we are trying. Please do not suspend football. Please retweet. Share wide and far.”. The Chibuku Super Cup tournament was thrown into disarray last night. The top-flight league clubs had completed the first stage of the round-robin stage and were scheduled to enter into the reverse matches this week. The top two teams in each group were going to proceed to the quarter-finals. Premier Soccer League chief executive Kenny Ndebele on Sunday said they stand guided by the Government. “We will follow all Government directives and guidelines,” he said.
