In a latest update through the bank’s magazine, managing director, Mr Ciaran McSharry said plans were underway to roll out more digital packages guided clients’ service needs. “It seems just like yesterday when we were planning for the inception of our first digital channels to market. Now we can hardly imagine transacting in their absence.
