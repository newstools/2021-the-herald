The Herald Tadious Manyepo in Zvishavane
SUBSTITUTE Bruno Mutigo scored a quick-fire brace to inspire Ngezi Platinum to a come-from-behind 2-1 win over FC Platinum in a Chibuku Super Cup tie at Mandava. FC Platinum had scored through Silas Songani in the 38th minute. As Ngezi pressured, in search of an equaliser in the second half, FC Platinum defender Gift Bello lost his cool and was red-carded for remonstration. Ngezi took advantage of their numerical edge and found a formula to beat their opponents. The Mhondoro team top the Group 4 standings now with nine points, after winning all their three games, while FC Platinum are second on six. Triangle and Whawha are one point each. Teams
