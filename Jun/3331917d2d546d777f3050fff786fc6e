The Herald LONDON. — The England and Wales Cricket Board are investigating reports a second England player posted historical “offensive material”, a day after bowler Ollie Robinson was suspended for past racist and sexist tweets. Wisden said it uncovered a tweet containing a racist term but had “obscured” the identity of the player, who was under 16 when it was posted. In a statement, the ECB said the social media post had been “brought to our attention” and the governing body would make further comment “in due course”. On Sunday, the ECB suspended 27-year-old Robinson from international cricket pending an investigation into tweets posted in 2012 and 2013. He was dropped from the squad for the second Test against New Zealand, which begins tomorrow at Edgbaston, and left the England camp to return to his county, Sussex. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson backed comments made by the Culture Secretary that the ECB went “over the top” in suspending Robinson for decade-old posts. Former England captain Michael Vaughan disagreed, saying the ECB “dealt with it correctly”. “They had to act,” Vaughan said on the Tuffers and Vaughan podcast. “I know there was pressure from powers within that they were potentially going to ask him to leave the game after day one and not participate in the remaining four days — I thought that would have been a little over the top.” Vaughan added it was “a serious issue” that Robinson — who was making his Test debut at Lord’s when the tweets were revealed — would have to learn ” — BBC Sport.
