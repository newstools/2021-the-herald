A 21-year-old man has been arrested in Warren Park, Harare for allegedly threatening to shoot a neighbour with his father’s gun after their dogs had been involved in a scuffle last week. Police have since urged firearm owners to properly secure their guns so that they wont fall into the wrong hands. The man whose name is still being withheld was later disarmed by people in the area and a report was made to the police. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the incident and said investigations were still in progress. “The ZRP reiterates that firearm owners must secure their firearms and use firearms for the purpose they were registered for. “This follows a case of unlawful possession of firearm which occurred in Warren Park on June 10, 2021, where a man aged 21 threatened to shoot his neighbour with his father’s firearm after their dogs had engaged in a scuffle. The man was later disarmed by members of the public. Investigations are underway,” he said. Police also urged the public to properly secure their guns as they also risk them being stolen by criminals and used to commit armed robbery cases. Several motorists have this year lost their guns to thieves who break their vehicles while parked in separate incidents. Some of the guns were recovered while others have not yet been found.
