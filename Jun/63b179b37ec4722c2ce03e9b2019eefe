The Zvishavane miners are appearing in the Champions League for the  sixth time. They were given the nod by ZIFA, to once again represent the country basing on their status, as the last club to win the league championship in 2019. The domestic top-flight league championship hasn’t taken off, since FC Platinum beat CAPS United, on the final day of the season, two years ago. Zimbabwe, however, will not be represented in the Confederation Cup, for the second year running. According to the CAF statement, the starting date of the new season of inter-club competitions, will be September 10.

With clubs expected to beef up their squads, to accommodate the rule of five substitutes, which has been extended to the coming season, CAF also extended the CAF Central Matching System registration base, to August 15. “The rule of five substitutions has been extended for the 2021/2022 season, and each club will be allowed to register 40 players, instead of 30 as usual, and nine players will be on the bench, instead of seven, which is the usual number. “Player registration in the CAF CMS Registration Base has also been extended to August 15, 2021.’’ FC Platinum are inactive, following the suspension of all domestic sporting activities, in the country. Only international competitions are getting exemptions after satisfying certain requirements. However, with the Chibuku Super Cup now set to be completed, the Zvishavane miners are set to get more game time, as part of their preparations, for a return to the big league.
