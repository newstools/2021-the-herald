GEMS captain Felisitus Kwangwa’s Surrey Storm will be hoping to end their season on a high this afternoon when they play against Wasps at the Copper Box court in the Vitality Netball Super League last game of the season in the UK. On Sunday they lost 35–48 to Saracens Mavericks. Surrey Storm had a subdued season managing only two wins. They had 17 defeats. Kwangwa, who was in the starting line-up against Mavericks, yesterday had a brilliant game and came up with a good intercept for her team but in the end, they were on the losing side. Surrey had a great start and were leading in the first quarter, but Mavericks moved a gear up in the third quarter to take a narrow lead. Surrey are 10th in the 11-team league with six points. Manchester Thunder are in pole position with 51 points followed by Team Bath Netball who also have 51 points. The top four teams qualify for the play-offs that determine the Vitality league champions. The platform to play in the United Kingdom Super League provided Zimbabwe skipper Kwangwa with new challenges which improved her game. Kwangwa made history when she became the first Zimbabwean to feature in the English Netball Super League. Kwangwa is on a one-year contract, having signed for Surrey Storm last year in November. Surrey’s interest in the goal defender developed when Zimbabwe national team participated in the 2019 Vitality Netball World Cup held in Liverpool, England.
