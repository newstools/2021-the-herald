THE International Cricket Council is set to induct 10 legends of Test cricket into the ICC Hall of Fame to celebrate their contributions towards the development of the game. The global cricket governing body said in a statement that 10 legends of the game, who have made a significant contribution to the history of Test cricket will be inducted this Sunday. They will join 93 players who are already in the illustrious list of ICC Hall of Famers, making the total now to 103. The special edition ICC Hall of Fame show will be hosted by Alan Wilkins streamed live on all ICC digital channels, including Facebook and YouTube. The show will feature interviews from the inductees and reactions and insights from a specialist panel of guests including Lisa Sthalekar and Lawrence Booth, who will also be joined by two special inductees making their way into this league of legends. The 10 icons inducted as part of this special edition have been voted for by the ICC Hall of Fame Voting Academy, comprising of living Hall of Fame members, a FICA representative, prominent cricket journalists and senior ICC figures. ICC Acting Chief Executive Geoff Allardice said the event was significant as it also coincided with the hosting of the first ever World Test Championship final. “It is an honour for us to announce a one-time induction of ten cricketing greats into the ICC Hall of Fame to coincide with the first ever final of the World Test Championship in Southampton. “We are celebrating the history of the game and what better way than to honour some of the greats that founded and played the game across different eras. These are all players with a legacy that will continue to inspire future generations for years to come.”
The selection has been divided into five eras with this special intake seeing two players from each of the following cricket epochs joining the ranks of the world’s greatest players:
