The Herald BENGALURU. – Discounts on items ranging from fast food to flights are being offered by Indian firms keen to lure people to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, as the economy re-opens gradually from weeks of lockdown. While businesses in the West make similar offers to dispel vaccine hesitancy, India is badly short of doses for its population of nearly 1,4 billion, and the incentives could serve mainly to attract more customers. ”We feel it is our responsibility to contribute to the national vaccination drive by encouraging more people,” Sanjay Kumar, a senior official of Interglobe Aviation, which runs India’s biggest airline, IndiGo, said in a statement. Vaccinated customers, even those who have received just one dose, would get a discount of up to 10 percent, the airline said yesterday. The Indian arm of fast food giant McDonald’s is offering a 20 percent discount on meals, SoftBank-backed grocer Grofers a month’s subscription to its loyalty programme, and home appliances maker Godrej extended product warranties. State-run Central Bank of India Ltd  is offering higher interest on deposits from recipients of at least one dose To claim the discounts, people must show their vaccination certificates issued by the government. – Reuters
