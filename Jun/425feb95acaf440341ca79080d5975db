The coach insists he is concentrating on building a competitive team for the 2021 championship season. His team fluffed a number of clear-cut chances, including a penalty, in this dull goalless draw against Yadah at the National Sports Stadium yesterday. “We are preparing a team for the season. I am a coach who wants to be very pragmatic,” said Chitembwe. “We are not only focusing on Chibuku Super Cup because after this competition we have a lot to look at as well. “We don’t want to put ourselves under pressure. We are looking at a bigger picture. “The lads are playing their own part. We have only played three games and it is coming out nicely. That is how a team is built. “I am very happy with the way the team is improving. “We dominated from start to finish, we got it very right tactically, physically and technically but mentally, we were not up there. “We lacked composure, especially in the attacking third. “We did everything right but we failed to retain high concentration levels in the decisive moments.” Despite some individual brilliance from few players, including Harare City’s Ben Musaka and Issa Sadiki of Yadah, the match was dull.
