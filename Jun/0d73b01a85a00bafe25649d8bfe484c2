The Herald RIO DE JANEIRO. — Hosts Brazil will open the Copa America with a game against Venezuela in the capital Brasilia. The final will be played at Rio de Janeiro’s Maracana stadium, the South American Football Confederation said on Wednesday.

More than 460 000 Brazilians have died from Covid-19. The Copa will go ahead, however, with Brazil kicking off Group B against Venezuela at the Mane Garrincha stadium on June 13. Also in the group are Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Argentina open their campaign at Rio’s Nilton Santos stadium against Chile on June 14. The group also features Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay. Rio is the only city where two stadiums will be used, with the other venues in Goiania and Cuiaba. The semi-finals are scheduled for the Nilton Santos stadium on July 5 and the Mane Garrincha a day later. The Maracana will host the final, the only match to be played there, on July 10. — AFP.
