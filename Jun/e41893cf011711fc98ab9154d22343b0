The Herald HONG KONG. – Cathay Pacific has told its aircrew that they must get a Covid-19 vaccination by 31 August or risk losing their jobs. The airline said staff rostering has become “difficult and complicated” because of a need to segregate vaccinated and non-vaccinated crew. Cathay Pacific said it could, in the “short-term”, accommodate those employees not able to take the vaccine. But it said: “We will review the future employment of those who are unable to become vaccinated.”  The carrier added that it would “assess whether they can continue to be employed as aircrew”. The Hong Kong-based airline said that 90 percent of its pilots and 65 percent of its cabin crew have been vaccinated or have appointments to receive the injection. But it said it was “becoming clear that only fully vaccinated aircrew will be able to return without quarantine from most places”. In order for Cathay Pacific and the global airline industry to recover, “vaccination is a critical component”. “After very careful consideration, we have now made the decision that all Hong Kong-based crew members must be vaccinated against Covid-19 by 31 August 2021,” it said. It comes as Hong Kong prepares to relax some Covid-19 travel restrictions as early as the end of this month. Hong Kong residents will have to quarantine for seven days, instead of the current two-week period, if they are fully vaccinated. – BBCWorld
