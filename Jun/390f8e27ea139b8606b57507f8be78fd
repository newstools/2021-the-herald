The Herald Simon Muzenda Terminus tout stabbed to death while tussling for passengers Crime Reporter In an incident that has left passers-by and travellers shell-shocked, a tout was stabbed to death by a colleague at the bustling bus terminus along Simon Muzenda Street (former Fourth street) early this morning following an altercation over passengers. Witnesses say the incident occurred around 5am as the touts tussled for the early morning Mutare-bound passengers. The altercation involved a crew from CAG Travellers Coaches, which later left for Mutare after the incident. Police said the tout who was stabbed on the chest, died on the spot and investigations were still in progress. National police spokesman Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the incident and said he will provide more details about the incident. The Simon Muzenda Bus Terminusâ€™s menacing touts have been a cause of worry for both passengers and authorities. Passengers accuse the touts of unruly behaviour and harassment of the travelling public. In September 2017, a Harare man died after he was manhandled by touts while intending to board a bus to Mutare at the terminus along Robert Mugabe Road. Mathias Gore of Glen Norah C was in the company of his family when the incident occurred around 5.30am. Gore, who was on his way to Mozambique, was also robbed of his wallet containing an undisclosed amount of cash and personal documents, including his passport. In March this year, police arrested four touts who were caught on camera harassing an elderly woman at Dulivhadzimu long distance bus terminus in Beitbridge. The four were arrested following a meeting between the police and intercity bus operators in the border town. Government then said the days of harassment by touts were numbered as it declared a war on them following the circulation on social media of the video in which the woman was filmed crying while being harassed at Dulivhadzimu.
