The Herald BATON ROUGE, Louisiana. — A Baton Rouge family got the shock of a lifetime last week when an enormous amount of money was mistakenly deposited into their bank account. Darren James said his wife called him frantic, telling him to have a seat before showing him that US$50 billion had been deposited in their account. “It was crazy just to see what it looks like because I’ve never seem that many zeros in my life,” said James. After noticing the money, he called his bank hoping to find out how it got there.“I wasn’t going to keep it. The thing that was most baffling was, we don’t even know where it came from. We don’t know anybody with that kind of money,” said James. Although he didn’t know how or why, the bank started reversing the error right away. “A hold (was) placed on it. It showed up on Saturday to make a deposit for our daughter. It stayed there Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday it was gone,” said James. The family took screenshots of the account to remember the once-in-a-lifetime error. In a matter of days, their billionaire status was gone. – WVLA.com
