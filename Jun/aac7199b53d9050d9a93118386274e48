The Herald Blessings Chidakwa Municipal Reporter Harare City Council has restored water supplies to Norton after one week as the local authority agreed to make a weekly payment plan of $1 million to clear its $177 million debt with the first payment having already been paid. Norton Town Secretary Mr Kizito Muhomba who, last week, described the situation as desperate and had indicated that they owe $117 million has confirmed that water supplies have been restored. Harare City Council spokesperson Mr Michael Chideme yesterday said they had agreed to reconnect water supplies after negotiations. “They have a proposal to pay $1 million every week. This means it will take 177 weeks to retire the debt. Today (yesterday) we temporarily opened water for them for 24 hours to allow for further negotiations,” he said. Norton is receiving five megalitres daily against its own demand of 25 megalitres.
