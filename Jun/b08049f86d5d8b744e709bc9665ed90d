The Herald NEW YORK. – Morgan Stanley employees and clients who have not received their Covid-19 vaccine will be barred from entering the bank’s New York offices. “Starting July 12 all employees, contingent workforce, clients and visitors will be required to attest to being fully vaccinated to access Morgan Stanley buildings in New York City and Westchester,” said the memo, signed by chief human resources officer Mandell Crawley. After that date, those who do not attest to being fully inoculated would lose building access, Crawley wrote, adding that the “overwhelming majority of staff” had already reported getting their jabs. The policy was designed to speed up the process of getting offices back to normal, the bank said. Morgan Stanley had already implemented “vaccine-only” workspaces across some divisions including institutional securities and wealth management to enable “enhanced collaboration and productivity”, the memo said. Morgan Stanley’s vaccination policy is the strictest yet among large Wall Street banks, which have been at the forefront of the push to convince workers to return to the office. Earlier this month, rival Goldman Sachs made it compulsory for staff to disclose their vaccination status, but unvaccinated staff are permitted in buildings as long as they wear masks and practise social distancing.  – FT
