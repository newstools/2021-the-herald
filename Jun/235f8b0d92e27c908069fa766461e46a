The Herald RIO DE JANEIRO. — Copa America hosts Brazil saw their 10-game winning run come to an end as they drew 1-1 with Ecuador in Goiania. The point took Ecuador into the quarter-finals, with holders Brazil having previously booked their place in the knockout stages. Eder Militao headed Brazil into the lead from Everton Soares’ free-kick for his first international goal. But Angel Mena rifled home from Enner Valencia’s flick-on to equalise and send Ecuador through. Mena was a first-half replacement for injured Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo. Ecuador had only needed to match Venezuela’s result against Peru — who had already qualified —in Sunday’s other game. Andre Carrillo scored the only goal in that encounter as Peru won 1-0. Both Brazil — who had won every game since November 2019 — and Ecuador must wait until Group A is over before discovering their quarter-final opponents. — BBC Sport.
