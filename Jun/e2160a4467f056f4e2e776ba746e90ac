The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter THE much-anticipated Afri- Italia Soccer Trials, scheduled for June 25 to 27, have been postponed indefinitely due to the re-imposition of lockdown restrictions in the country. Local junior football players were supposed to have an opportunity to impress some AC Milan Technical Academy directors at Gateway High School in Harare this weekend. In a statement organisers of the trials said they had to follow procedures and encouraged those who had prepared not lose hope. “We apologise for the inconvenience caused but cannot wait to see you at a later date. “We encourage you all to still register in the meantime to reserve your spot and make payment at a later date once we confirm a new date. “The rescheduled visit will see us come in collaboration with the Lombardia Uno AC Milan Technical Academy and cater for all ages boys and girls who need to prove their talent.” Opportunities for selected players will see players between the ages of 17 to 21 eligible to be connected to USA university scholarships, as those aged between 16 – 20 will be eligible to earn a trial at a professional club or academy in Europe while those between 10 and 15 will have a lifetime invitation to AC Milan Junior camp, they stated.
