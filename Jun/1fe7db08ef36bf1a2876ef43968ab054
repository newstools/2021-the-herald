The Herald WINDHOEK. – The Namibian government is doing its best to resolve the current shortage of oxygen in hospitals, opposition leader McHenry Venaani said on Monday. “President [Hage Geingob] assured me that trucks carrying oxygen were held up at borders and have been released. Promised me he is pushing his end to resolve the crisis,” Venaani said in a Twitter message. This followed his earlier tweet in which he called on the government to explain the ongoing shortage of oxygen in hospitals. “The situation of a lack of oxygen in our health facilities must be clarified and government must be answerable to the death of many. It is enough that we might not have the jabs, but pure oxygen cannot be acceptable,” the president of the Popular Democratic Movement said earlier. The number of new Covid-19 cases and deaths were rising to levels never seen before, media reports said. The Namibian Sun reported said  that Namibia’s Covid-19 battle was now characterised by critically ill patients “gasping for air” as they line up in desperate need of oxygen. – ANA
