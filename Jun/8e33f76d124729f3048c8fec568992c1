The Herald Herald Reporter Zimbabwe recorded seven Covid-19 related deaths and 371 new cases yesterday alone, justifying the tightened control measures which took effect this week. Although the country has defied odds with a thorough and effective response to the pandemic, winning rave reviews from the World Health Organisation (WHO), rising cases in recent weeks have prompted the Government to implement tighter control measures, including placing four districts under localised lockdown. Zimbabweâ€™s response to the pandemic has been anchored on health education and a raft of containment measures. Government has been emphasising that the best way to beat the pandemic is reaching by herd immunity in the ongoing national vaccination campaign. So far, 1 647 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19 since last year.
