The Herald Fungai Lupande Mash Central Bureau Two Mbire men have appeared at the Guruve Magistrates Court after being arrested in possession of 34kg of ivory and looking for a buyer. The pair, Patrick Mapfumo (46) of Bandazi village and Garinga Mberengwa (44) of Kasuwo village in Mbire, appeared before Guruve magistrate Mrs Rumbidzai Mugwagwa. They are facing possession of unregistered or unmarked ivory without a permit charges, and were remanded in custody to June 15. The Zimbabwe National Parks (ZimParks) is being represented by its intelligence officer Mr Moffat Murove. Prosecutor Mr Albert Charewa told the court that on May 31, ZimParks members received a tip-off to the effect that Mapfumo and Mberengwa were in possession of ivory, for which they were looking for buyers. ZimParks officials teamed with CID members in Guruve and went to Madzomba Village to investigate. The court heard that at around 11pm, the security team met the accused who were carrying two tasks of unmarked ivory. They allegedly failed to produce a permit or license authorising them to possess ivory, and were immediately arrested while the ivory, weighing 34,12 kg, was recovered.
