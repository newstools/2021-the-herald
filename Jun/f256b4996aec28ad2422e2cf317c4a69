The Herald CAPE TOWN. – Moments before delivering an important announcement in Cape Town on Tuesday, President Cyril Ramaphosa, who is a stickler for time, had a moment of panic when he could not locate his iPad. His announcement that the National Ports Authority was now an independent subsidiary of Transnet was briefly delayed because he was unable to find the device which contained his speech, bringing comic relief into the room. After being introduced to the podium by acting presidency spokesperson Tyrone Seale, Ramaphosa said in jest: “I am looking for my iPad. Somebody stole my iPad. “Somebody decided they want to dispossess me of my iPad, so I want that. Can I have my iPad please? They stole it.” Ramaphosa, who looked genuinely puzzled, then said: “I had my iPad.”Holding the microphone and looking sideways, he asked Seale: “Do you know where they took my iPad to? This is the problem of always handing your gadgets to other people. It is always best that I should keep all these things with me all the time,” he said. Looking at Seale, a seemingly confused Ramaphosa said: “I had my iPad. I had it in my hand. It’s gone. I have lost it, it seems.” The president rarely deviates from his written speeches. Seale asked Ramaphosa to take a seat while officials tried to locate the device. A few hours later, the “first iPad”, as Ramaphosa’s head of digital called it, was found and back in its owner’s hands, to his relief. Seale later reintroduced the guests and invited Ramaphosa back to the podium. With his iPad in hand, the president thanked guests for their patience and made his announcement. The Presidency later twitted: “Thank you, South Africa. There was no question of the iPad being missing or stolen. The President was making a light-hearted point while waiting for the iPad to be brought to him – which it was before he began his remarks to media.” – TimesLIVE
