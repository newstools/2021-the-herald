CAPS United are closely monitoring goalkeeper Tonderai Mateyaunga ahead of the Chibuku Super Cup clash against ZPC Kariba this Sunday. The goalkeeper pulled a muscle during the tense Harare Derby against bitter rivals Dynamos which ended in a 1-1 stalemate last Sunday. However, coach Darlington Dodo feels there is a ray of hope filtering into the Green Machine’s casualty ward following the recovery of some of the long term casualties Ian Nyoni and Leeroy Mavhunga. The duo was part of the line-up during the derby, with Nyoni playing a late cameo while Mavhunga was confined to the bench. However, Phenias Bhamusi, who only played one game in this campaign, is still to make full recovery while Valentine Musarurwa is a long-term worry. “I am happy that the other two guys are back but Bhamusi is yet to gain full fitness. Our goalkeeper Tonderai Mateyaunga is also under observation after pulling a muscle during the Derby. We hope it does not get serious,” said Dodo. “Overall, it’s getting better. We played Nyoni last week because he had shown good response. With Leeroy, we felt he was not upto the level that expected him to be. So it was not wise to play him and then probably he gets back to the injury ward again. “Bhamusi is making recovery. The good thing is he has started some light training, although he is still under observation from the team doctors. “They are still working on him, and then they will give a final assessment. If you ask me, I would tell you we want him back as soon as possible, as the technical team. “This will obviously widen our election range. It’s something that we want because the games are coming thick and fast,” said Dodo.
