The Herald LONDON. — Gareth Southgate won over an English public who were sceptical about his ability to lead the Three Lions with a run to the World Cup semi-finals three years ago and is already silencing his critics at Euro 2020. For the first time at a European Championship, England are off to a winning start as Southgate’s bold selection paid off in a 1-0 win against Croatia on Sunday. Next up is a fixture against Scotland tonight, with the chance to book their place in the last-16 with a game to spare. The match starts at 9pm. Southgate’s team selection for the opener caused a social media storm before kick-off as Raheem Sterling retained his place ahead of Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish despite a poor end to his season at Manchester City. Kalvin Phillips’s inclusion alongside Declan Rice in midfield and the decision to start Kieran Trippier at left-back also raised eyebrows. But those calls proved inspired as Phillips set up Sterling for the only goal, while Trippier helped keep a clean sheet. “I don’t think there would be one person in the 65 million English population who would pick that team today,” said former Manchester United captain Gary Neville, who played with Southgate at Euro 96. “I thought he managed that game unbelievably today. I think Southgate is our greatest asset.” Southgate’s lack of a stellar coaching CV at club level has counted against him in the eyes of his doubters. — AFP.
