The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga-Sports Reporter THE qualification race for the biannual Eisenhower Trophy resumes with one of the qualifying events — the Mawegu Championships — set to tee off at Kadoma Golf Club this morning. The Zimbabwe Golf Association announced the event will go ahead today with expectations of high turnout. Several top amateurs, including Rashid Mohammad and David Amm, who is back in the country, are expected to battle for top honours. Amm, who is based in United States, where he is at University of Toledo Athletics, left the country as the leading amateur golfer. Mahammad finished third, in the last event on the Zimbabwe Golf Association calendar, the Matebeleland amateur championship. Several events, including the Mawegu Champs, formerly the Mashonaland East West Championships, will be considered for the points, in the race for the prestigious tournament. The 2022 edition of the Eisenhower Trophy was postponed due to the Covid-19 and the next event is set for September, in Guyancourt, France. Zimbabwe were in 2010 represented by Scott Vincent, Nyasha Muyambo and Roger Jack, in the event, in Argentina. Vincent, Ray Badernhoist and Barry Painting went for the 2012 edition in Turkey. Meanwhile, the monthly Eagles Golf Association will be played today at Chegutu Country Club, with a full field, expected to tee off.
