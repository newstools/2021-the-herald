THE inaugural Marvelous Nakamba Under-17 football tournament hangs in the balance following the Sports Commission’s suspension of all sporting activities in the country on Sunday evening. This is in compliance with the Government’s directive which announced a new raft of measures to help in containing the Covid-19 cases, which are on the rise again. Vice President Constantino Chiwenga in his press statement on Saturday said all gatherings, except for funerals, are banned. “These gatherings include but are not limited to weddings, church gatherings, music festivals, and sports activities,” said Vice President Chiwengwa in the statement. The Marvelous Nakamba Under-17 tournament was scheduled to be staged from June 18 to 19 at White City and Luveve in Bulawayo. The tournament had received special clearance from the relevant authorities. The Aston Villa midfielder is currently in the country and had invited some scouts from Europe to grace the tournament. Teams that will take part in this year’s first edition are Highlanders, Dynamos, Njube Spurs, Hwange Dynamo, Albun Academy, Bulawayo City, Ajax Hot Spurs, and Chicken Inn. About 400 players are set to play in the inaugural tournament. Nakamba is keen on vibrant junior programmes as he is a direct beneficiary of the same programmes, during his time at the Bantu Rovers academy, which was led by Methembe Ndlovu. “Grassroots football is a very important part of the survival of football,’’ said Nakamba when he launched his tournament last week. “We have all come through the system of being afforded chances, at an early stage, and it is befitting that we continue the tradition of supporting grassroots sports. “We appreciate the approval, from the custodians of football, and it is our hope that this tournament will raise the curtain to the commencement of junior football in the country.”
