ZIMBABWEAN female ultra-distance runner, Emily Hawgood, made a huge impression when she came seventh at the Western States 100-Mile Endurance Run. The Western States 100-Mile Endurance Run is the world’s oldest 100 mile race. The run starts in the Olympic Valley, California, near the site of the 1960 Winter Olympics, and ends in Auburn, California. In the decades, since its inception in 1974, Western States has come to represent one of the ultimate endurance tests, in the world. On Saturday, Hawgood came seventh, in a time of 19 hours 13 minutes 53 seconds. The Zimbabwean ultra-distance runner, who is also an accomplished triathlete, has always been passionate about running. She began her journey, in ultra-events, in 2017. And, she has proven her pedigree, in the past few years. Two years ago, Hawgood came second, at the Ultra Trail Cape Town 100 miler, in South Africa. She crossed the finish line in 12 hours 3minutes 51.seconds. Hawgood, who lives in the United States, really wanted to run the Western States.
