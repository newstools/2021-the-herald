The Herald Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter PAKISTAN Super League cricket side Multan Sultans have hailed their Zimbabwean coach, Andy Flower, as a true legend of the game. The 53-year-old former national team captain was inducted in the ICC Hall of Fame at the weekend. Sultans, who are currently taking part in the Pakistan Super League, had double celebrations following Sunday’s win over Flower’s former team, Peshawar Zalmi. This was their second win in as many matches since the resumption of the tournament. The club posted a short video yesterday with the caption: “A little celebration for our coach Andy Flower, a true legend of the game, who has been inducted in to the ICC Hall of Fame. Special thanks to W. Hotels for making the occasion so memorable.” Flower was presented with a cake decorated with miniature Zimbabwe national flags. Zimbabwean Blessing Muzarabani is also in the team’s books. Flower was recognised by ICC among the 10 inductees as one of the two players whose contributions to the game were eminent during the “Modern Cricket Era” – between 1996-2015. He became the first Zimbabwe cricket player to be inducted in the ICC hall of Fame. Flower played 63 Tests, scoring 4,794 runs at 51.54, took 151 catches with nine stumpings as a left-handed wicket-keeper batsman. His grit, determination and will to succeed meant at one point he was ranked number 1 batsman in the world. He carried Zimbabwe’s batting for long periods, setting the record for the highest Test score by a wicketkeeper with an innings of 232 not out against India at Nagpur in 2000. Later, he became a hugely successful coach, leading England to the number one spot in the MRF Tyres ICC Test Rankings for Men. He is currently head coach of Multan Sultans in the Pakistan Super League.
