The Herald Tadious Manyepo Sports Reporter WARRIORS forward Tino Kadewere says he is happy with the way his former club Harare City are playing in the Chibuku Super Cup. Addressing the Harare City players in Harare this morning, Kadewere said he has been impressed by the way they are playing in the tournament they have won more than any other club. He was part of the limited crowd who watched the team’s goalless draw against Yadah last week. “You are all my friends, I played with most of you when I used to turn out for Harare City. This team remains my home and I should say, I am very much impressed with the way you are playing,” he said. “You should all work hard for the success of this great team as we all expect you to fight for this badge. “I am very excited with the way everyone is trying to fight for the badge. I urge all of you to continue working hard.” Kadewere is back home for the off-season break after helping his French Ligue 1 side Lyon to Europa league qualification. He scored 10 goals and chipped in with three assists. His Kadewere Foundation has also brought along other corporate partners including May 4 International which is dressing the team’s technical department as well as Perfect Design to the municipality club.
