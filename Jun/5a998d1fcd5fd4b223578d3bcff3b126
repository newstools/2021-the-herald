The Herald ZIMBABWE Cricket have called off the second four-day match between their A team and South Africa A, despite getting clearance, for them to complete the match. The match started on Sunday. Only one day could be completed before the Government directive, to suspend all sporting activities, in the country, came into effect. There was a ray of light yesterday when the Sports and Recreation Commission granted ZC permission to complete the match. However, ZC said the approval did not come in time, to allow for the continuation of the game, leaving them with no option, but to call of the game. “Despite this unfortunate turn of events, ZC would like to place on record its sincere gratitude to the SRC for working round the clock to secure us the exemption,’’ ZC said in a statement. “With Covid-19 cases on the rise, the Government suspended all sporting activities in the country as part of new restrictions aimed at containing the spread of the virus that came into effect on Monday. “The abandoned match was the last of a tour which was being held in a bio-secure environment and included another four-dayer and four one-day games that were completed without any positive case recorded. “Apart from South Africa A, ZC has since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic also successfully hosted the South Africa emerging women’s side as well as the Pakistan senior men’s and women’s teams. “Throughout the pandemic, the overriding priority for ZC has been to aid the health and well-being of the nation and our communities, including players, coaches, staff and supporters. “ZC will continue working closely with the Government, the SRC and all relevant authorities to ensure all Covid-19 protocols are strictly adhered to and that all our facilities, including grounds and hotels, remain as safe as possible for everybody involved.’’ — Sports Reporter/zimcricket.
