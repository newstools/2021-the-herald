The Herald LONDON. — British number one Johanna Konta has been ruled out of Wimbledon on the eve of the tennis tournament because one of her team has tested positive for Covid. Konta, who was seeded 27th, has been deemed a close contact and must therefore isolate for 10 days. The 30-year-old was due to play Czech Katerina Siniakova in the first round today. “Our heartfelt sympathies are with Johanna and we hope to see her on court soon as possible,” Wimbledon tweeted. The Grand Slam started at the All England Club yesterday, returning after being cancelled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. All players must stay at the official hotel in Westminster and are allowed to bring three people with them. Konta chose her fiancé, her coach Dan Smethurst and her strength and conditioning coach Gill Myburgh. Two weeks ago, the world number 31 won her first WTA title for four years in Nottingham. Konta had been hoping for further success at Wimbledon, where she reached the semi-finals in 2017 and the quarter-finals two years ago. Speaking in a news conference on Saturday, Konta said staying at the official hotel has been an odd experience. “It’s odd to drive past kind of my home every day on the way to Wimbledon,” she said. “It’s a small price to pay to be able to be back and playing again here at Wimbledon. It’s kind of like an all-inclusive cruise, that’s what it feels like. I’ve never been on a cruise, but that’s how I imagine an all-inclusive cruise to be.” — BBC Sport.
