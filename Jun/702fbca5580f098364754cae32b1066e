PREMIER Soccer League have tightened Covid-19 measures as they brace to resume the Chibuku Super Cup. The premium cup tournament had been frozen last week owing to the spike in coronavirus cases in the country. But the Government has since cleared the contest, which is being played in clusters to resume under strict health protocol. And the PSL have since informed the clubs that fixtures would be postponed should there be at least seven positive cases in the league at any given period. In a statement PSL spokesperson Kudzi Bare said clubs should provide Covid-19 results before fixtures are released. She hailed the move by the Government to allow them to resume the Chibuku Super Cup games. “Matches shall be postponed if there are seven (7) or more reported cases at the same period of time,” she said. “We are grateful to the Government of Zimbabwe, the Sports and Recreation Commission, ZIFA and all our partners for enabling us to resume play.”
