The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga0-Sports Reporter LOWER football leagues affiliated to ZIFA got a ray of hope to resume operations after the Sports Commission gave some academies the greenlight to resume operations. The lower leagues cater for Division One and Two. ZIFA Southern Region Division One League chairman, Tapela Ngwenya, said there seems to be some light at the end of the tunnel and they are hopeful they will get a positive respond soon. “After the successful applications by 36 academies, we are now hopeful that we will soon get there. We have been waiting patiently, and we will remain so, and monitor the progress being made by those who have been given the clearance, “Covid-19 has seen several sporting activities being suspended and the gradual return to action is imminent. ‘‘As a region, we are prepared for the resumption as we are training our compliance officers already. ‘‘We are also having inspections, of the venues at the moment, and encouraging clubs to be ready for the resumptions and also monitor their venues so that they will not be caught unaware,” said Ngwenya. ZIFA Eastern Region Division One League chairman, Davison Muchena, said there is hope they will be back in action soon. ‘‘There are a lot of expectations and the times we are in are very challenging but we have to remain resolute and be prepared for the future. The teams have been idle, for more than a year, and it will be good if they are given the greenlight to start the season, before the end of the year.  ‘s a region, we are more than read for the successful return of soccer, which we believe has been successfully held by the Premier League, through the hosting of Chibuku Super Cup,” said Muchena. Harare Province Division Two A and B chairman, Robert Tembo, believes the greenlight given to the academies was a huge sign. “At the moment we are looking forward to have a draw for our tournament which was prematurely ended, because of the Covid-19 last year,” said Tembo.
