UNITED States-based golfer, Tafadzwa Nyamukondiwa, returned home to claim the Mashonaland West Golf Union Amateur Golf Championship at Kadoma Country Club. The event was the third national event, on the Zimbabwe Golf Association calendar, and had a huge turnout of over 50 players, taking part. Nyamukondiwa, who has represented the country in several events, from juniors to amateur level, is back home from his base at University of Drexel. The MAWEGU tourney followed all the Covid-19 protocols. Nyamukondiwa, whose sister Margete is also doing well in the women section, had rounds of 76, 75 and 76, for a gross total of 227. The former Zimbabwe captain moved from Western Texas College to Philadelphia-based NCAA Division I University of Drexel, for the last two years of his student athletic career. Nyamukondiwa shrugged off the challenge of Clifford Sibanda, of Warren Hills Golf Club, who posted 79, 80 and 73, for a gross total 232. Sibanda was an outsider, going into the tournament, but did well to beat a number of golfers who were expected to do better than him. Trust Makamidzana, Rasheed Mohammed, Raphael Jazi, Lloyd Dhaka, Dylan Mangabhai, Innocent Mukumba and Tariro November also took part in the tourney. Nyamukondiwa started playing golf 10 years ago, at Wingate Park Golf Club, and later moved to join Chapman in Harare, where he was a member, until the time he left for the United States. At the age of 15 he captained Zimbabwe in the Tri-Nations tournament, which also featured Malawi and Zambia. Zimbabwe won that tourney. The talented golfer also represented Zimbabwe in the All-Africa Golf Championship, which the country hosted in 2017, at Royal Harare Golf Club. Meanwhile, Marondera Golf Club hosted the monthly Marketers Association of Zimbabwe Golf Society tournament, at the weekend. The event saw 46 players taking part. Association chairman, More Moyo, said they were happy with the turnout.
