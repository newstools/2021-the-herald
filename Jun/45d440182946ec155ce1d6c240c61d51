The Herald Crime Reporter Police have arrested three suspected armed robbers who were part of a four-man gang that robbed a man in Lupane of US$200 and a cellphone while armed with machetes and logs. The three were arrested after the victim identified one of the robbers and alerted the police. Investigations on the case are still in progress. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said: “On June 25, 2021, police in Lupane arrested three men in connection with a robbery case which occurred at Ndwawanga business centre, Inyathi, where four suspects who were armed with machetes and logs attacked the complainant and stole US$200, Itel phone and other valuables. “The complainant later identified one of the suspects and alerted the police leading to the arrest of the three suspects. Police have since launched a manhunt on the remaining suspect.” Early this month, several people were robbed while going home during the evening.
