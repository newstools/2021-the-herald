The Herald LUSAKA. — Zambia will meet Great Britain women’s football team at Stoke City’s stadium on July 1 in the lead up to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. The Copper Queens qualified for their first women’s Olympic tournament following a 4-4 draw with Cameroon which saw them earn qualification on the away-goals rule. The continent’s only qualifying team for Tokyo 2020, Zambia have been drawn in Group F and will face incoming England coach Sarina Wiegman’s Netherlands on July 21 in their first match of the Games. For Great Britain comprising England, Wales and Scotland players, it will be only the second time that Team GB have entered a women’s football team since the introduction of the event to the Olympic schedule in 1996. Team GB fielded a football squad for the first time in the London 2012 Olympic Games. The team reached the quarter-finals, with the United States the eventual winners after beating this summer’s hosts Japan 2-1 to win gold for a third consecutive time. “I’m delighted that we have secured a match on home soil which allows fans to watch us play before we depart for Tokyo,” said head coach Hege Riise. “It’s been a long time since supporters have had the opportunity to watch any of the home nations play, and the chance to see our GB squad compete before the Games is a rare occasion indeed. “We’re so excited to see what we can achieve out in Tokyo and we’ll go out there aiming to win. ‘’But we also aim to inspire young female footballers from across Great Britain to take up the support and further grow the game. “We’re honoured to welcome Zambia to Great Britain for this match. They have excelled in securing qualification for the Olympics and their achievement and the legacy they will provide will also help grow the women’s game in Zambia. “On behalf of our entire squad I’d like to thank National Lottery players for making it possible not only for us to host this match but to prepare us in the best possible way to compete for gold in Tokyo.” — AFP.
