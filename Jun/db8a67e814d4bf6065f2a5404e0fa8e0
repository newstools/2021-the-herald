The Herald George Maponga in MASVINGO The long-awaited development master plan for Tugwi-Mukosi Dam in Chivi South, Masvingo, is now complete and will soon be tabled in Cabinet, paving way for the country to extract full economic benefits from the vast water body. Expediting crafting of the Tugwi-Mukosi master plan was one of the main targets of the Second Republic under President Mnangagwa, with his administration working round the clock to make sure Zimbabwe attains food sufficiency and becomes a net exporter in line with Vision 2030. Full exploitation of Tugwi-Mukosi, Zimbabwe’s largest inland water body, commissioned in 2017, was being hamstrung by delays in crafting the development master plan, which designates land use pattern in and around the dam, including demarcation of the exact areas earmarked for irrigation. The reservoir, with a full capacity of 1,8 billion cubic meters, was initially billed to irrigate around 25 000 hectares, but advances in irrigation technology over the years have pushed estimates for irrigable land to over 40 000ha. Masvingo is set to become greenbelt and the nation’s irrigation hub courtesy of Tugwi-Mukosi Dam irrigation water. The dam is expected to bring a hive of economic activities, as apart from irrigation, tourism can also become a major source of income at the dam and in areas surrounding it. A town is expected to spring up around the nearby Ngundu Growth Point, resulting in the industrialisation of the area and the creation of jobs for the locals. A 15 megawatt power plant is being set up at the dam. The Government has prioritised dam construction and drilling of boreholes across the country to improve access to clean potable water and for irrigation purposes. The completion Tugwi-Mukosi development master plan coupled with recent commissioning of other infrastructure across the country highlights Government’s investments in key and strategic water bodies around the country and represents a significant turnaround as economic reforms have enabled the freeing up of resources for capital projects. Projects around dams are already transforming districts and fostering reliable access to water for communities where the impact of climate change is being intensely felt. Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Resettlement Minister Dr Anxious Masuka disclosed that the Tugwi-Mukosi master plan was good as done. Speaking to The Herald, Dr Masuka said the nation was on the cusp of accruing positive spin-offs from the giant water body. <img class="size-full wp-image-546837" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/agr.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/agr.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/agr-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Resettlement, Dr Anxious Masuka “The master plan (for Tugwi-Mukosi) is now 99.9 percent complete, the technical teams have completed their work and the working party on the project will be meeting next week after which the plan will be taken to a Cabinet committee and then Cabinet hopefully for approval and implementation,” said Dr Masuka. In May this year, President Mnangagwa commissioned the Muchekeranwa Dam, formerly Causeway Dam, that will benefit the provinces of Mashonaland East and Manicaland. Apart from commissioning the dam, the President launched the Presidential Fisheries Scheme and the Muchekeranwa irrigation project, which are spinoffs from the massive dam that was built through a public private partnership. The President also officiated at the ground breaking of the Muchekeranwa-Wenimbe pipeline that will see the town of Marondera getting water from the new dam, with the surplus going to the capital city, Harare. The commissioning of the multi-million dollar Machekeranwa/Causeway Dam in Marondera East is yet another fulfilment of the President’s promise to ensure that the district realises its full economic potential through irrigation development. The dam will provide water for domestic, agricultural, and industrial use was completed this year after Government released funds following the dawn of the New Dispensation under the leadership of President Mnangagwa. Just before Muchekeranwa, President Mnangagwa had commissioned Marovanyati Dam in Buhera which is already benefiting the locals through irrigation and fishing. The dam is expected to transform Buhera from hunger to food self-sufficiency as it has enough water for the setting up of massive irrigation schemes. Work on the long-awaited Gwayi-Shangani Dam in Matabeleland North is now at an advanced stage as President Mnangagwa ensures the 109-year water project that will change the status of the province and Bulawayo City is finally completed. President Mnangagwa has so far commissioned several infrastructural development projects across the country that include dams, roads and power plants.
