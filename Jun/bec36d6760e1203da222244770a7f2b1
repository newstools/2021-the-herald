The Herald PARIS. — Defending champion Rafael Nadal reached a record-extending 14th French Open semi-final after outlasting Argentina’s Diego Schwartzman in a tricky battle played in front of 5 000 fans in Paris yesterday. Spanish third seed Nadal, who has won a record 13 titles, won 6-3 4-6 6-4 6-0 against 10th seed Schwartzman on a buzzing Court Philippe Chatrier. Nadal (35) will next face either Serbian top seed Novak Djokovic or Italian ninth seed Matteo Berrettini. Nadal is still deemed the favourite to land the title on Sunday, where a 14th victory would move him clear of Federer in terms of most men’s Grand Slam triumphs. After winning for the 105th time in 107 matches at Roland Garros, Nadal said: “The numbers are just amazing. But I can’t think about that now, honestly. Let’s talk about that when I finish my career. “Now is a moment to be happy. I won an important match today against a tough opponent. I was able to find a way to play my best tennis in the moment that I really needed.” Up to 5 000 spectators were allowed on Chatrier after France’s coronavirus restrictions were loosened yesterday, providing an increased buzz as Schwartzman looked to create an upset at the place where Nadal has dominated since 2005. Even though Nadal cruised through the fourth set, it was a far from straightforward afternoon for the Spanish left-hander. After serving out the opener for his 36th successive winning set at Roland Garros, most would have backed Nadal to complete another three-set win to equal his personal record of 38 in a row. But there was a twist. Schwartzman, playing with aggression and without fear, levelled at one-set all and became the first player to take a set off Nadal at Roland Garros since the 2019 final. —BBC Sport.
