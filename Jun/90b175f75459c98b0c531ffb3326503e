HILTON Mudariki will lead the Sables in “the Battle of Zambezi” rugby match against Zambia set for Harare Sports Club this afternoon.
Mudariki has been part of the team since 2013 and is hopeful that they will come up with a win. “I am hopeful that we are going to win the match,” he said. “We are glad that we are having this friendly match which will help us prepare for the World Cup qualifiers.” Mudariki was educated at The Heritage and St John’s Prep then at Michael House in Natal, where he played for their First XV side in 2009 and 2010. He represented Natal at the Under-18 Craven Week where he signed a contract with Western Province.

In 2013, he made his debut for The Sables against Namibia in Windhoek and also made his HSBC World Series debut in the Port Elizabeth sevens the same year. Mudariki represented the University of Johannesburg in the Varsity Cup in 2015, 2016 and 2017. His performances earned him a professional contract with Jersey Reds RFC in the English Championship.
