The Herald Blessings Chidakwa Herald Reporter Zimbabwea has joined the Kenyan community living in the country to celebrate their independence day known as Madaraka Day, through planting trees in Harare gardens. Harare Metropolitan Minister for Provincial Affairs and Devolution Engineer Oliver Chidawu was the first to plant a tree followed by the Kenyan Ambassador to Zimbabwe Stella Munyi and Harare City Council acting Mayor Musarurwa Stewart Mutizwa. Other trees were planted by Harare acting town clerk Eng Mabhena Moyo and Foreign Affairs and International Trade Ministry Deputy Minister David Musabayana. Speaking during the event, Mr Mutizwa said the planting of trees in the city was a sign of cordial relations enjoyed between Harare and Nairobi. “A tree represents life and peace,” he said.  “Both the two countries share a lot among them, we are both peace loving countries. “We want to continue enjoying our relations and exchanging programmes, be it in business or any sector.” Madaraka Day commemorates the day Kenya attained self-rule on June 1, 1963.
