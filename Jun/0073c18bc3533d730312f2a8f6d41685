Gate is a product of the Lancashire Steel development side. “When I was growing up, we used to have junior leagues, which helped us a lot,’’ he said. “But, today, there is nothing like that and that means our standards continue to fall. “I was developed at Lancashire Steel juniors, where we learnt a lot as we used to play league games, but these days young stars cannot have those privileges anymore. “I decided to give back to the community, and started an academy based at Chana Primary School in Mbizo, Kwekwe. “The academy caters for all age groups, from Under-8 to Under-17. “Because I have travelled a lot, and I love the young stars and our football, which has gone down, I want to try to lift the sport, from                     grassroots.’’ He challenged other former players to come on board and help the emerging players.
