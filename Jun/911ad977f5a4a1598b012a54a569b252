The Herald MADRID. — Sergio Ramos yesterday broke down in tears at an emotional press conference as he said farewell to Spanish giants Real Madrid after 16 years there. The 35-year-old defender brought down the curtain on his glorious time with the club on what he described as his “most difficult day.” After club president Florentino Perez paid homage to the departing captain, Ramos only managed a few words of his speech before emotion got the better of him. With his family watching on, he said: “I’ll always keep Real Madrid in my heart. “A marvellous stage in my life is over, but a new exciting future awaits and I am looking forward to showing my level and winning some more trophies. “You’re never prepared to say adios to Real Madrid but the moment has arrived. This is a ‘adieu’ as sooner or later I will return. “I would like to thank the fans, they carried me in their arms at all times. I would have liked to say goodbye at the Bernabeu. But I will always carry you in my heart.” Former team-mate Karim Benzema wished Ramos well on Twitter: “More than a Capitan, my friend, my brother, thanks for all the moments we spent together on the road of success for the @realmadrid. Wish you all the best legend @SergioRamos.” — Mailonline.
