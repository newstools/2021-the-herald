The Herald Farirai Machivenyika Senior Reporter The Affirmative Action Group (AAG) has called on Government to implement the reserved sectors’ policy as enunciated in the revised Zanu PF Indigenisation Policy (2020-2030). This was said by the AAG president Cde Mike Chimombe in an interview after paying a courtesy call on Zanu PF Secretary for Administration Cde Obert Mpofu last week. “We paid a courtesy call on the Secretary for Administration as the AAG to introduce ourselves as the new AAG executive and also brief him on how we want to drive the empowerment agenda,” he said. “Our major thrust is that the Government should implement the reserved sectors’ policy as we believe this will benefit the majority of the population, especially women and youths and help reduce poverty.” Some of the sectors identified in the ruling party’s policy include retail and wholesale trade, barber shops and beauty salons, estate agencies, grain milling, bakeries, artisanal mining, tobacco grading and marketing and employment and advertising agencies. Cde Chimombe said foreigners should only come in to enhance production and productivity. He said the implementation of the policy would go a long way in reducing unemployment and other social vices affecting young people. Cde Chimombe said the new AAG executive wanted to complement Government’s empowerment drive and contribute towards the attainment of Vision 2030 of an upper middle income economy.
