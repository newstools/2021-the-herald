The Herald Nyore Madzianike–Senior Court Reporter TWO men yesterday appeared in court on allegations of duping a Green Success company employee of R138 000 in a car deal with one of them pretending to be deputy health minister Dr John Mangwiro. Patrick Chirume of Epworth and Edgar Masora of Glen Norah in Harare were not asked to plead to the fraud charges when they appeared before regional magistrate Mr Stanford Mambanje and were remanded in custody to today for bail application. Mrs Netsai Mushayabasa, appearing for the State, alleges that on June 16 Mr Munyaradzi Chauraya came across an advert where Chirume’s brother, Governor Chirume, was advertising cars and claiming to be a car dealer in South Africa. Chauraya is said to have ordered an Isuzu KB300 which Chirume offered for R138 000 inclusive of driving it to Beitbridge Border Post. Mr Chauraya accepted the deal and the next day deposited R130 000 into Chirume’s South African account with FNB Bank. Governor Chirume then contacted his brother in Zimbabwe who allegedly brought Masora into the deal. No vehicle was delivered, and Mr Chauraya became suspicious. Patrick Chirume then allegedly took Masora to Mr Chauraya and introduced him as the Deputy Health Minister Mangwiro and said his money would be reimbursed in cash. No cash came through, and Mr Chauraya, without car or cash, filed a police report. Police are said to have recovered a line registered in Dr Mangwiro’s name from Masora. The two are expected back in court today for their bail application.
