The Herald Business Reporter The Zimbabwe Commercial Rabbit Breeders Association (ZICORBA), has concluded a landmark deal with reputable South African veterinary specialists, Vriesit Andrology Laboratories, for artificial insemination (AI) on rabbits. The agreement will thrust Zimbabwe into the league of a few countries in the world using (AI) on rabbits, in a development that is expected to significantly boost the country’s commercial rabbit breeding industry. France and South Africa are among only a handful of countries globally that practice artificial insemination on rabbits, especially for the purposes of commercial production of rabbits reared for meat. ZICORBA has secured a niche for rabbit meat on the local market with demand expected to rise to over 25 tonnes per month. The farm-gate price for rabbit meat is estimated between US$4 and US$4,50 per kilogramme. ZICORBA president Regis Nyamakanga confirmed the development in an interview saying they have partnered SA’s Vriesit Andrology Laboratories for the first ever artificial insemination on rabbits in Zimbabwe. The parties are planning to undertake the inaugural AI on rabbits in Zimbabwe in October this year, the first artificial insemination to be taken on rabbits in Africa outside of South Africa. “We have been in discussions with Mr Henk van Der Laarse, the founder and CEO of Vriesit Andrology Laboratories to deliver the first artificial insemination in Zimbabwe in October this year, as we move to revolutionise rabbit breeding in the country.
