The Herald JOHANNESBURG — The veteran duo of Bernard Parker and Willard Katsande have completed a decade of service at Kaizer Chiefs. They have joined just seven other players, to have lasted this long at the club, within the PSL era. Parker and Katsande — who are now both 35 — joined Chiefs at the beginning of the 2011/12 season and 10 years at Naturena should surely elevate them to legendary status having also won trophies through that time. Parker arrived from FC Twente following a two and half year stay in Europe which took him to Serbia, Holland, and Greece. He has gone on to score 57 goals for Amakhosi moving into the top 10 scorers at the club through the PSL though he has slowed so badly in front of the net that he has been on target once in the last 72 games. His seniority in the dressing room has meant he has been trusted with captaining the team in recent times. Katsande was a surprise signing from Ajax Cape Town where he had battled in the only season he spent there. However, since arriving at Chiefs he has played with his heart on his sleeve playing the most football of all players that have been with the club over the last decade. For most of the last 10 years he has provided the balance and bite needed from a defensive midfielder. — KickOff.com
