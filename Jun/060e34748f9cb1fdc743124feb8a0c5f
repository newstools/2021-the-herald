The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Senior Sports Reporter LOCAL athletes that were looking forward to take part in the Africa Senior Athletics Championships this month in Lagos, Nigeria, have been dealt a huge blow following the cancellation of the meet due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic continues to have a negative effect on sport with the championships that were scheduled for June 23 to 27 in Lagos cancelled. The continental competition was set for the first week of June in Algeria before it was moved to later this month with Nigeria expected to host in attempt to save it as the pandemic continued to pose a threat. The Confederation of African Athletics wrote to the national federations informing them of the unfortunate development. “It is with regret that I announce the cancellation of the Africa Senior Championships, which were planned to take place in Lagos from June 23 to 27, 2021. “Indeed, after the Algeria’s desire to postpone the championships, and realising the need to offer competition to our athletes, the Confederation decided to find a host country so as to save the championships. “Unfortunately, Nigeria, which committed to host the competition has just informed CAA that the Scientific Commission had not allowed to host such a big competition. “CAA apologises for all these inconvenience and solicits your understanding for this situation beyond its control,” read the letter by CAA’s director general Lamine Faty. It’s a huge blow for athletes considering it was also a qualifying event for the Olympics. Most African athletes that are still chasing qualification to the Games were expected to compete in what was likely to be last qualifying event since the deadline for track and field events qualification is June 29.
