The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Senior Sports Reporter GEMS’ coach Lloyd Makunde says he is pleased with the way Felisitus Kwangwa’s game has been shaping up under her Vitality Netball Superleague club Surrey Storm in the United Kingdom. Kwangwa has been with Surrey Storm for their 2021 season and she has had some good games although limited. It has not been an easy road for the club that is currently second from the bottom in the 11-team league but Makunde says the Zimbabwe captain proved her abilities in the games she featured in. “I am happy to say that the experience she gained is going to help us as a team although the game time she got was not what we had expected. “It’s very difficult coming from Zimbabwe but I am praying they will call her again for another season because when she played, she proved she is a force to reckon with. “I see her being called again to have another chance,” Makunde said. Kwangwa is expected back home in a few weeks’ time as the netball season comes to an end in the UK. It is not yet clear whether the club will extend her contract or not. Surrey are left with two games in their campaign before the curtain comes down on the season at the end of this month. They take on Saracens Mavericks on Sunday in a round 20 match. They will then face Wasps the following day in a round 19 postponed game after a member of Wasps’ playing squad returned a positive Covid-19 result last Sunday. The two-time league champions failed to make the top four to qualify for the play-offs that will see the two winning teams proceed to the final to determine the 2021 champions. The semi-finals and final are scheduled for June 26 and June 27 respectively.
