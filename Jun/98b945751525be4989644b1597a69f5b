The Herald Africa Moyo in VICTORIA FALLS President Mnangagwa says Zimbabwe is honoured to host the 10th Session of the Pan-African Postal Union (PAPU) Plenipotentiary conference and the 39th ordinary session of the Administrative Council. He said this today in his remarks during the official opening ceremony. “I welcome all delegates who are present here and those attending virtually,” said the President. “The people and Government of Zimbabwe are particularly honoured that the Pan African Postal Union found our country a suitable host for your conference as you enter into this next decade of the organisation’s existence. “Following the postponement of your meeting last year, my country does not take for granted this show of unity and commitment that has seen you proceed to convene, even in the face of the Covid-19 challenging times. Such resilience and boldness is indeed who we are, as African people,” he said.
