The Herald Tadious Manyepo Sports Reporter BOXER Charles Manyuchi has been given the go-ahead to defend his WBF world title against Uganda’s Mahomed Sebyla in Masvingo on July 3. The promoters of the fight, the Charles Manyuchi Boxing Academy, have been in panic mode after the Government banned all sporting activities last week owing to a surge in Covid-19 cases in the country. Matters weren’t helped either as the authorities cleared some sport codes excluding the July 3 bill two days ago. But, the 31-year old can now focus on preparing to defend the belt which he will also unify with two other titles after it emerged this afternoon the pugilist has been given the greenlight to fight next week. One of Manyuchi’s coaches, Ali “Otto” Phiri revealed to The Herald that the fight has been allowed to take place. “The fight is on. We have been cleared by the Government. It will take place on July 3 in Masvingo under strict Covid-19 conditions,” he said.
