The Herald Conrad Mupesa Mashonaland West Bureau VACCINATED and asymptomatic Covid-19 patients who are failing to isolate themselves after testing positive are behind the scourge of Covid-19 cases in Hurungwe district, The Herald has learnt. Hurungwe is among the three districts in the province that were put under indefinite localised lockdown. The district development coordinator and head of Hurungwe Civil Protection Unit (CPU), Mr Andrew Tizora said the surge in the positive cases was mainly attributed to asymptomatic patients. Mr Tizora said this in Chinhoyi yesterday while addressing a provincial CPU emergency meeting meant to address surging Covid-19 cases in the Mashonaland West. “While we recorded 10 Covid-19 deaths and all from unvaccinated cases, there is a need for those that were vaccinated but tested positive to be compliant. Most of the vaccinated Covid-19 cases in the district are generally asymptomatic and up and about. “The danger now is, these people are not complying with isolation regulations as they are roaming about. As a district task force team on Covid-19 together with the Joint Operating Command (JOC), we are working to ensure that these positive cases comply with regulations as it is a worrisome issue,” he said.
