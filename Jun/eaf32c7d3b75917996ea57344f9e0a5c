The Herald Columbus Mabika Herald Reporter Six new Supreme Court judges, who we re elevated from the High Court, took their oaths of office today before Deputy Chief Justice Elizabeth Gwaunza. The six are Judge President George Chiweshe, Justices Alfas Chitakunye, Samuel Kudya, Felistus Chatukuta, Joseph Musakwa and Hlekani Mwayera. The development comes as Zimbabwe steps up efforts to enhance the Supreme Curtâ€™s manpower after five of its six judges were appointed to the Constitutional Court bench two weeks ago. President Mnangagwa upgraded the six to the Supreme Court bench after consultations with the Judicial Service Commission as required by the law.
