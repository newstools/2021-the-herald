The Herald COPENHAGEN. — Kevin de Bruyne inspired Belgium to a comeback 2-1 win against Denmark that secured their place in the last 16 of Euro 2020 last night. Fans and players paid tribute to Danish midfielder Christian Eriksen, who is recovering after suffering cardiac arrest. Eriksen is in hospital after he collapsed on the pitch at the Parken Stadium during Saturday’s game against Finland. Yussuf Poulsen gave the hosts a dream start just one minute and 39 seconds into the game, slotting in after a mistake in the Belgium defence. De Bruyne was sent on at the start of the second half and the Manchester City midfielder changed the game. He played a part in the equaliser, receiving a pass from Romelu Lukaku before superbly finding Thorgan Hazard to fire home, and then drove in the winner with 20 minutes remaining after a brilliant move started by Lukaku. Martin Braithwaite went close to a late equaliser for Denmark but his header skimmed the top of the bar. — BBC Sport.
