The Herald LONDON. — The Swedish billionaire Daniel Ek is preparing to increase his Arsenal takeover bid to more than £2 billion following his unsuccessful opening offer of £1,8 billion last month. Ek claimed that under-fire Gunners owners the Kroenke family had told him that they “didn’t need the money” when he tried to buy the club last time. However, sources close to the Ek camp have disclosed that a second bid “north of £2 billion” is being readied and that they “are not going anywhere and want to get a deal done”. Club insiders have admitted they are waiting for a second offer. Spotify founder Ek (38) launched his bid in the wake of the European Super League collapse. He went public to state that the offer included fan ownership, representation at board level and a golden share for supporters. Ek has Gunners legends Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and Patrick Vieira on his bid team. An offer of an extra £300 million may well test the Kroenkes’ resolve, despite an insistence that the club is not for sale. The US owners, led by Stan Kroenke (73), who assumed full control in 2018, are very unpopular with large sections of the club’s support. — Mailonline.
