The Herald Bulawayo Bureau FINANCE and Economic Development Minister, Professor Mthuli Ncube, says massive economic developments projects could be unleashed from the Tugwi Mukosi Dam, which would contribute more to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The minister visited the dam project recently where he highlighted the need to urgently harness opportunities from the giant water body. “I visited Tugwi-Mukosi dam in Masvingo province. The dam has a massive capacity of 1.8 billion cubic meters of water, for irrigation, fisheries, tourism facilities, and hydro power generation. When unleashed, this potential is a game-changer,” he posted on Twitter. “Tugwi -Mukosi dam has over 10 islands which can accommodate hotels, lodges, camping facilities, inter alia. All these developments, including irrigated agricultural activities, will contribute to the GDP of the province and country at large.” The minister’s sentiments come at a time when the Government and private sector players are still fine-tuning proposals for commercial utilisation of the massive water body, which was completed and commissioned in 2016. The dam only supplies water to a few sugarcane estates in the Lowveld. Although the Government has said it has completed the drafting of an estimated US$20 million master plan that spells out a number of business opportunities to be arise from the dam, implementation has not taken shape. Local business leaders have said the dam has a huge potential to attract massive investment that will change the face of Chivi and the province at large. At least 100 000 fingerlings were planted at the dam by Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management to promote fishery business while a number of diverse opportunities ranging from tourism, wildlife, farming and, hotel and hospitality industry. President Mnangagwa is on record saying Government would ensure that provinces fully benefit from their resources under the devolution of power framework.
