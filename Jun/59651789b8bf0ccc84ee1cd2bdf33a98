TENNIS coach Richmore Murape says the death of former Dynamos coach and player David “Yogi” Mandigora has robbed the country of a unifier in sport. Murape, who knew Mandigora not just as Dynamos coach but also a tennis player as he used to play social games at Old Hararians, said the late football coach was a unifier and friendly person. “In tennis we knew Yogi was a tennis player. He used to play his tennis at Old Hararians with some of the guys that play at Old Hararians. “Personally I knew him as a Dynamos coach, and he was open to everybody and I knew him as a tennis player again. It’s painful to lose such a person. “I still remember we met again at Paul Chingoka’s funeral and we were talking about tennis and sport and he met with his old friends from Highfield and they were talking about sport and how they grew up. “So I think from sport lines, we have lost a good person who was able to bring people from different sporting disciplines together, was passionate about sport and he was friendly to everyone. “So we are very saddened by the death of the former Dynamos coach and player Yogi Mandigora,” said Murape.
Mandigora died on Saturday. He was 64.
