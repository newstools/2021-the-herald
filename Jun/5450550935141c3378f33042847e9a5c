WARRIORS skipper Knowledge Musona is celebrating his birthday today. He has turned 31. The media-shy skipper posted his picture accompanied by a message on his Twitter page. “Grateful to God for another year. Happy birthday to me,” he tweeted.
The post received a number of messages from the fans wishing him a happy birthday. The Footballers Union of Zimbabwe also wished him a great day. Interestingly, South African fans showed the midfielder that he still has a special place in their hearts and expressed their desire to have him back at Kaizer Chiefs. Musona’s future at the Belgium club Anderlecht is under the spotlight amid indications that coach Vincent Kompany is likely to offload a number of senior players who are returning from loan stints.
