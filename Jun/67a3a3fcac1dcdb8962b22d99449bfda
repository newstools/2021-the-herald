GoFit founder and certified fitness trainer Chaodza said it is a complimentary gesture to the team as they prepare for the soon to start season. “This is just a complimentary gesture to the team as they prepare for their netball activities. “As GoFit we specialise in everything that has to do with fitness hence the idea of partnering with this team but we are also looking forward to engaging more sports codes so as to encourage them on the importance of staying fit as a sport personality. “GoFit Crossfit centre is based at Allan Wilson School. Cross-fit is a full body workout, a combination of tyre work-out, aerobics, zumba and weights, basically it’s everything. “It’s basically for weight loss, toning and a bit of bulking. But we are not for bodybuilding,” said Chaodza.
