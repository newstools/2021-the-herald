The Herald BEIJING. – China fired back yesterday over allegations against China from a  communiqué released after the conclusion of the NATO summit and warned that it would not sit back if any others pose systemic challenges to it, and it will closely watch NATO’s strategic adjustments toward China. Responding to Nato leaders’ tough stance on China in a communiqué, the Chinese mission to the European Union (EU) spokesperson said yesterday that China will not present “systemic challenges” to others. Nato’s claims have slandered China’s peaceful development, misjudged the international situation and its own role, and continued the Cold War mentality mixed with group politics, said the mission, firing back at the remarks in the communiqué signed off in Brussels by leaders from the 30 members in the alliance at the urging of the new Biden administration. NATO leaders said in the communiqué released after the meeting on Monday that “China’s stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to alliance security.” It also accused China of rapidly expanding its nuclear power, and being opaque about its military modernisation. In response, the mission said China has always pursued a defensive national defence policy, and has kept its military modernisation legitimate, open and transparent. “In 2021, China’s defence budget is 1,35 trillion yuan (US$209 billion) accounting for 1,3 percent of the nation’s GDP, which is less than NATO’s ‘pass line’,” the mission spokesperson said. “In contrast, the 30-member NATO alliance has a total military spending as high as US$1,17 trillion, making up over half of the global sum and 5.6 times that of China.” – Global Times
