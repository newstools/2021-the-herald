Father isn’t a mere tittle. With it comes responsibility. Being a father is one of the most difficult, but necessary jobs in life. It has its ups and downs. It has its good trinkets too, but at the end it is a total package; that of being mostly the family’s beast of burden. In the 21st Century, fatherhood is expected of every man who sires or adopts a child . However, it doesn’t come cheap as it means one has to take responsibility for the fruits of his loins or adoption. In most cases, where there are disputes among couples, it’s either there is a “deadbeat” dad who has either forgotten or deliberately shirks responsibility. Tomorrow, real fathers will be celebrated in some parts of the world for the role they play in moulding families. It is Father’s Day. In this day and age, daddies are not only the biological fathers, but anyone who assumes fatherly roles when the man responsible fails or dies. Back home in Zimbabwe and traditionally, male siblings to a married man are considered fathers, but taking responsibility is all that is demanded of fatherhood. As we mark this day, families from the first to the second generations are expected to unite and celebrate together. The day might as well mean many things for different men, and can come with associated feelings of love, connection, and caring; and sometimes, grief, loss and regret. The Herald on Saturday Lifestyle explores the importance of fatherhood  and how men can celebrate all forms of this relationship during Covid-19. <img class="size-full wp-image-555028" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/Untitled-2-14.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/Untitled-2-14.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/Untitled-2-14-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Granddad Gilbert Aaron with grandson Casey, who is popularly known as Cassette on social media While Father’s Day can seem to have a very commercial focus; it remains a day of celebrating the most important relationships in men’s lives. Caring for the next generation is a key role for men and is often associated with images of being both provider and protector. This Father’s Day will be unlike any other as gone are the days of huge family get-togethers and packed restaurant dinners. Husband and manager to songstress Janet Manyowa, Munya said this Father’s Day was an opportunity to reconnect though challenging because of Covid-19. <img class="size-full wp-image-555036" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/Untitled-5-3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/Untitled-5-3.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/Untitled-5-3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Munya and son, Waishe Manyowa “The lockdown has opened up more time to some of the things I have always wanted to do like learning to play an instrument with my son. I will set aside the day to be with family, prepare a good meal and good fellowship,” he said. Manyowa’s son, Waishe, said his gift to his father was a themed cake of one of his favourite instruments — the bass guitar. For Leonard Chidavaenzi (76), the day was usually celebrated at church during their days and it was not much popular compared to these days. <img class="size-full wp-image-555030" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/Untitled-3-6.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/Untitled-3-6.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/Untitled-3-6-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Sekuru Herbert Kurima with grandson Takomborerwa “It was really a big thing during our days. We only celebrated it at church and we would receive little gifts. Now times have changed and our children do all sorts of things. Sometimes I wonder why spending so much money? It is love that counts only,” he said. His son, music producer MacDonald Chidavaenzi said Covid-19 had shifted the narrative but as challenging as it is, they would still do something at home. “Well, I intend to take ‘Mdhara’ out, but because the places are closed, we would end up having a barbecue at home. Daddy Leonard is more like a friend. We normally do our Sunday drives. I appreciate this man and ever since the death of my mother he was everything, so this is an opportunity to utilise love,” he said. Men’s popular fashion houses Bachelor’s Republic and 4 May International announced that they were doing fashion styling for dads this Father’s Day commemoration. “Covid-19 has affected a lot in our business, but it is also an opportunity to show love. We encourage our customers to do something for their dads, we are also offering free online fashion styling as with Covid-19 people are limited in the shop. Treat your father the special way,” said shop attendant Brighton Mapfumo. Content creator Lucky Aaron said nothing much can be done this Father’s Day because of the current situation. “We can’t do much on this day, maybe we will cook mazondo and he enjoys it with his grandchildren. My father Gilbert loves to play with his four grandchildren. I hope we will or he will visit as he usually does. It is just that we can’t even go fishing or usual braai spots but it is a day of bonding and the children love him so much,” he said.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-555037 aligncenter" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/Untitled-6-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/Untitled-6-4.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/Untitled-6-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Entrepreneur Elton Kurima added that the lockdown has been a roller coaster full of ups and downs and on Father’s Day was going to hang out with his father and the boys (children). His father Herbert Kurima concurred that during their time, the day was not remembered much as they didn’t know it. “In our time, it was alien to celebrate Father’s Day compared to now as this day is very popular. We never did anything nor respect it. It was not on our calendar. The greatest gift I have received is the love of my grand-children. I have received a lot of gifts from my children and I am grateful,” he said. Grandson Chikomborero Kurima said he loves his father and grandfather so much and wishes to spend time with both of them every day. “I love Sekuru Kurima as he always tells me stories. If daddy has money, I would suggest we just go out as boys, buy our food and return home. I want to buy sekuru and daddy a present, hopefully I will ask mum to assist me with that,” he said. <img class="size-full wp-image-555033" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/Untitled-4-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/Untitled-4-2.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/Untitled-4-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Fargio Marowa with children Sir Emmanuel, Believe Anopa and Dr Ruth Beloved For farmer-cum-politician Fargio Marowa who lost his father in 1998, he said, they grew up not even celebrating the day. He cited that the church played a pivotal role in educating them about the day and was now a happy father of two. “My father was born in 1918 and passed on in 1998, but as we grew up we didn’t know of father’s day. “The social media later has helped us to know of the day. I have received clothes from my wife and presents from my children as young as they are. The church played a vital role in celebrating Father’s Day as it is scriptural Proverbs 3:9- “We were taught to celebrate our fathers or father figures in the event that your biological father is no more. I have a father in-law, my big brother who represents my father and my spiritual father Prophet Emmanuel Makandiwa are my father figures who I am going to celebrate,” he said. He also said that the lockdown has negatively impacted this year’s celebrations as they were surviving on a hand to mouth basis. “This left me with limited options in celebrating our fathers both spiritual and biological. However, we don’t have an option. I have to call them and tell them how much they mean to me and my children. “If funds permit, I will buy small presents for them and will do better in the near future,” said Marowa.
