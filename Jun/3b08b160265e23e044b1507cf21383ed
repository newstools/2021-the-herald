Walter Marara, the company’s chief operations officer, said he expects the relationship to grow, with time. “We are happy to establish this ongoing relationship, with which has since started bearing fruits,’’ he said. ‘’We expect it to grow, as we wish to solidify our partnership, with Harare City. “More donations are to come and these will cover the whole team, including the technical department. ‘’We are also going to design face-masks, for the team to wear, while on and off duty, as a way of helping the players, from contracting the deadly coronavirus.’’ Harare City coach, Lloyd Chitembwe, said they were humbled by the donation. “It’s a very special gesture given the fact that these days things are difficult and if you happen to find someone coming to you, with a helping hand, you have to respect that,’’ he said. “We expect the priceless gesture to last and we also promise to pay back by representing the brand perfectly well in football.” Harare City face Dynamos, in their next Chibuku Super Cup assignment, at the weekend. In April this year, the club received a football kit from their former son, Tino Kadewere.
