The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Senior Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe National Karate Federation is next month scheduled to hold an extra-ordinary congress at Gweru Sports and Social Club to deliberate on several issues including the start of their activities. The congress comes after the national federation was granted provisional affiliation by the World Karate Federation. ZNKF president, Joe Rugwete, confirmed they will be meeting in Gweru on July 3. “Since we formed our organisation we have not had a congress…now that we have delivered the mandate given to us as the executive, we are going to give our members feedback on the progress made,” said Rugwete. They are planning to get their activities underway soon. “Now that we have registered, we are starting our programmes and we now have put in place rules and regulations in place, the code of conduct, a national team selection policy, anti-doping policy, tournament hosting procedures and the covid protocols. “So now we are presenting these for ratification because this was done by the executive, so people have to vote to say this is now binding. “Also our constitution states that if we have not achieved gender balance in our executive, we co-opt. So we will be looking at that. At the moment we have more men, so we expect to appoint a couple of women,” said Rugwete. Their affiliation to the WKF means they can now compete in regional, continental and international events.
