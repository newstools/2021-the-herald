Gospel musician Natsai will today release a single to inspire hope amid the challenges of Covid-19, drugs and depression. Titled ‘‘Zadzai Moyo’’, the song that will be released on YouTube, radio and TV, was produced by Nigel Nyangombe and Tererai Musuka. Natsai said the song examines the human heart. “The heart is like an empty vessel and always needs something to fill it up, something that either gives love to it or it gives love to,” she said. “When tragedy strikes and we lose that thing that was in our hearts we desperately seek something to fill that empty space in the things of this world. “The Lord calls us to drink from Him, to fill our hearts with his Spirit and never feel thirsty again. In the song, one cries out to God to fill the heart with living waters that satisfy the soul.” While our nation has been facing a lot of challenges including the Covid-19 pandemic, many people struggle from depression and cannot find anything that can satisfy them completely, said Natsai. A lot of people also suffer addiction from drugs, alcohol and other vices as they seek satisfaction of the soul. ‘‘Zadzai Moyo’’ calls people to seek satisfaction from God through prayer and develop an intimate relationship with God. Nyangombe, who did the instruments and backing vocals, heaped praises on Natsai’s exceptional composing and singing abilities. “Natsai’s gift is natural. She is a good composer, I didn’t have to help much on song composition and arranging. Her song writing is amazing. Also her singing is natural. She’s not trying to be someone else but only herself,” said Nyangombe. Natsai released her first song ‘‘Vanokurwira’’ in July last year which was also a word of encouragement for those feeling helpless. Natsai, whose full name is Evelyn Natsai Moyo, is a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Zimbabwe.  She is a chartered accountant by professions and is married with three children.
