The Herald PARIS. – A 28-year-old Frenchman who described himself as a right-wing or extreme-right “patriot” was sentenced to four months in prison yesterday for slapping President Emmanuel Macron in the face. Damien Tarel was also banned from ever holding public office in France and from owning weapons for five years over the swipe Tuesday, which caught Macron’s left cheek with an audible thwack as the French leader was greeting a crowd. During yesterday’s trial, Tarel testified that the attack was impulsive and unplanned, and prompted by anger at France’s “decline.” He sat straight and showed no emotion as the court in the southeastern city of Valence convicted him on a charge of violence against a person invested with public authority. He was sentenced to four months in prison and handed an additional 14-month suspended sentence. His girlfriend broke down in tears. Tarel, who shouted a centuries-old royalist war cry as he hit the president, described himself as a right-wing or extreme-right “patriot” and member of the yellow vest economic protest movement that shook Macron’s presidency in 2018 and 2019. Poised and calm, he firmly defended his action and his views on Macron, without providing details of what policies he wants France to change. Tarel acknowledged hitting the president with a “rather violent” slap. “When I saw his friendly, lying look, I felt disgust, and I had a violent reaction,” he told the court. “It was an impulsive reaction… I was surprised myself by the violence.” – AP
