The Herald Tadious Manyepo Sports Reporter CAPS United left-back Brandon Mpofu was left a disappointed man after his wasteful team’s goalless draw against ZPC Kariba at the National Sports Stadium. But, the defender has many reasons to celebrate. He was taken off towards the end of the first half after suffering what initially looked like a career-ending injury. The youthful player suffered a huge cut on his left ankle after coming together with ZPC Kariba right-back Collin Mujuru. He had to be stitched and he will be back training after two weeks. Mpofu, who made The Herald’s Chibuku Super Cup’s first round team should however count himself lucky after the tear narrowly missed his Archilles tendon. That would have meant disaster for the versatile defender. “He suffered a big cut on the ankle, that’s why we had to stitch him. He was lucky it didn’t each the Archilles tendon. “It may take two weeks to heal. Once the wound is healed he will be back.,” said Munyonga.
