National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed. “The ZRP warns members of the public against keeping large amounts of cash at home or business premises. “On June 13, 2021 a Chitungwiza woman aged 47, lost US$6 800 cash and US$760 worth of property to robbers,” he said.

The couple had advertised on various social media platforms that they were selling one of their cars resulting with the two robbers approaching them. “Members of the public are warned against trusting strangers. This follows a robbery case which occurred on June 6, 2021 in Mapolovele Village, Beitbridge. “A woman aged 33 was robbed of US$10 000 cash after she offered overnight accommodation to two men who masqueraded as bona fide buyers of a motor vehicle which the victim and her husband had advertised on several WhatsApp groups for sale,” Asst Comm Nyathi said. After being offered accommodation, the robbers later attacked the victim before disappearing with the cash.
