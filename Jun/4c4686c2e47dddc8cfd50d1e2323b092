The Herald LONDON. — Manchester City will make a take-it-or-leave-it £100million offer to Tottenham Hotspur for Harry Kane. That bid will come in next month after the European Championships – and City are determined to seal the deal quickly rather than let it drag on for the rest of the summer. But whether it proves sufficient to tempt Spurs into selling their prize asset before next season remains to be seen. The North Londoners chairman Daniel Levy values England skipper Kane (27) closer to £150m. That leaves a £50m black hole to fill, which could easily scupper Kane’s ambitions to exit for the Etihad in search of competing for major silverware on a regular basis. City are unwilling to go any higher for someone who is 27 and has suffered an increasing amount of ankle injuries in recent years. Those concerns mean Pep Guardiola’s Premier League Champions will walk away and drop their interest should Levy refuse to do business at their proposed price. Kane’s poor performances at the Euros in the last week are not doing him any favours in that respect either. The prolific ace lined up against both Croatia and Scotland flanked by City pair Raheem Sterling and Phil Foden. Yet so far that dream three-man attack has failed to click. And that fact will have been noted by City boss Guardiola as he attempts to acquire a lethal goalscorer to compliment his creative squad. Kane, with 34 England goals in 56 games, cut a miserable figure when surprisingly subbed by Gareth Southgate in each of those Group D games. — The Daily Star.
