A Singaporean company that has partnered with a local investment entity has expressed interest in investing over US$100 million in the next three years in various sectors of the economy. JB Group of Companies has partnered Manna Ventures Private Limited to explore opportunities in the country, as foreign investors warm up to President Mnangagwa’s “Zimbabwe ls Open for Business” stance. JB Group Chief Executive Officer, Mr Jamie Balaji, said Zimbabwe had immense potential due to its abundant resources. “Zimbabwe is politically stable and has got immense opportunities, especially in the mining sector,” he said. “If we get all the support to come to Zimbabwe, we are interested to bring US$100 million in investments for the next three or four years targeting mining, health and the pharmaceutical sectors.” JB Group has interests in various sectors spanning across mining, renewable energy, start-ups and waste management. <img class="wp-image-557154 size-large" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/Untitled-1-20-680x556.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="556" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/Untitled-1-20.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/Untitled-1-20-360x294.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Manna Ventures Director Anastancia Ndhlovu Manna Ventures Director and former Deputy Minister of Tourism and Hospitality Industry Anastancia Ndhlovu said the engagement with JB was inspired by President Mnangagwa’s Government thrust of opening up the economy to foreign investors. She urged fellow Zimbabweans to complement Government efforts in the economic revival agenda. “Zimbabweans should tap into the unending opportunities unveiled through Vision 2030, NDS1 and the engagement thrust in luring investors into the country,” she said. “We will soon liaise with responsible Government agencies in charge of bringing investors to deal with the formalities. It’s amazing how the President has managed to turn the country into an investment destination of choice.” Ndhlovu is also the Affirmative Action Group vice president for women and minorities, as well as the Leaders Without Borders Development Centre’s International Representative for Southern Africa.
