The Herald LONDON. — Pep Guardiola admits he is ready for a break as he heads back to see his family in Barcelona this week. It has been a lengthy and demanding season for his Manchester City side — chasing the quadruple for so long meant he has not seen some of his nearest and dearest since November. The next couple of weeks will be a time for him to switch off, enjoy some overdue sunshine and recharge. But he will not feel sorry for himself  for very long, as he sits on the beach. Very quickly his thoughts will start to turn to next season. He is set to come back to England in early July to get ready to do it all over again. Despite the rumours, he always planned to return — even if they had won the Champions League final against Chelsea in Porto on Saturday. Pep remains convinced there is more to do with City and this group of players and he has vowed to turn them into the best club in the world. After an outstanding campaign ended on a disappointing note in Portugal, he said: “I want to go home and be with my family. “It’s been a long time since I’ve seen them. “After that I’ll come back to the club. It’s going to be the best club in the world for the next few years. — The Sun.
