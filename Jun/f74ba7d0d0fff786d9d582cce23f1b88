The Herald South Africa’s top court has ruled against ex-president Jacob Zuma. He was found guilty of contempt of court after a series of corruption scandals. South Africa’s Constitutional Court ruled against ex-president Jacob Zuma, 79, Tuesday citing him for contempt of court prompted by his refusal to answer for corruption charges. Zuma faces two years in prison relating to charges that he permitted the looting of government coffers during his almost nine years in office. The court heard the contempt case in March and on Tuesday judge Sisi Khampepe said: “The Constitutional Court can do nothing but conclude that Mr Zuma is guilty of the crime of contempt of court.” Unanswered charges of corruption
In 2018, Zuma was forced to step down after being forced out by his own party, the ruling African National Congress (ANC), following a series of corruption scandals. Under immense pressure, Zuma set up the inquiry shortly before he was ousted. In July 2019, he testified only once before walking out of court and accusing the chair of the commission, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, of being biased against him. Since then, Zuma has repeatedly ignored requests to appear in court, citing medical issues and time needed to prepare for a different corruption trial. In November, he appeared in court briefly but left before he could be questioned. Zondo turned to the Constitutional Court and requested it intervene. Zuma then refused to participate in contempt of court hearings, addressing an angry letter to Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng that described an “atmosphere of judicial hostility” and “humiliation”.-dw.com
