The Herald BEIJING. – China’s anti-foreign sanctions draft law – the first of its kind – was proposed to the ongoing session of the standing committee of the 13th National People’s Congress (NPC) on Monday. The law is expected to provide strong legal support and guarantee for the country against the unilateral and discriminatory measures imposed by foreign countries. It was also widely hailed by Chinese legal experts as a necessary move to strengthen the country’s legal toolkit in the face of more blatant interference and crackdowns of the US-led West against Chinese entities and individuals. The announcement of the anti-foreign sanctions law was also in line with the top legislature’s annual work schedule, unveiled in March, which indicated that China will enhance legislation in foreign-related fields by focusing on moves against sanctions and interference, and countering long-arm jurisdiction.  The anti-foreign sanctions draft law is expected to be voted by the top lawmakers soon. – Global Times
