Yadah ….. (2) 2
CAPS United….. 1 TANAKA Shandirwa and Godknows Mangani ensured a come-from-behind victory for Yadah over CAPS United in a Chibuku Super Cup at the National Sports Stadium this afternoon. The Green Machine had scored through Ishmael Wadi five minutes into the game. But some lapse at the CAPS United back allowed Shandirwa to equalize 18 minutes later before Mangani converted a dubiously awarded penalty. Yadah are now second on the six-team log with eight points while CAPS United dropped to third with seven points.
