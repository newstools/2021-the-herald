The Herald Faith Katete and Millicent Mtombeni American media personality, socialite, model, singer, actress and DJ, Paris Hilton is in Zimbabwe where she is enjoying the reputable hospitality of Victoria Falls. The 40-year-old super celebrity is reportedly on a three-day visit to the country accompanied by her fiancé Carter Reum, an author, entrepreneur and venture capitalist. Victoria Falls, easily Zimbabwe’s most popular tourist destination, has over the years hosted famous people from all walks of life. The visit by Hilton during the Covid-19 era has been viewed as a vote of confidence in the country’s robust and rigorous measures to contain the pandemic. Zimbabwe Tourism Authority head of Digital Marketing Mr Godfrey Koti yesterday confirmed the visit of Hilton describing it as a huge endorsement of Zimbabwe as a safe destination. “It is obviously something very exciting to get such a huge endorsement. This can only be a testament that destination Zimbabwe is a safe place. “Remember Victoria falls has reached herd immunity and that is something that cannot be done in vain. We would like to thank the Government for pushing it through the Ministry of Health and Child Care, making sure that people are vaccinated. “It really builds up confidence in the market and on the international market in particular. Mr Koti said tourism was one of the hardest hits sectors by the pandemic adding that they were delighted by visits by such high profile people. “We are very elated as the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority to see Ms Paris Hilton here in Zimbabwe,” said Mr Koti. She is the great grand-daughter of legendary hotelier Conrad Hilton, making her the closest thing America has to royalty. Having made her mark as a catwalk model, she has turned her hand to writing and jewellery design as well as perfume creation.
