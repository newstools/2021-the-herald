The Herald George Maponga in Masvingo The Covid-19 district taskforce has ordered closure of N Richards Wholesale shop at Jerera Growth Point after three workers tested positive for the deadly virus. The taskforce has also since started decongesting the growth point, with police accompanied by Environmental Health Officers, deployed there beginning today to make sure movement of people is limited. All N Richard’s staff at Jerera have been put under mandatory quarantine for 10 days, while the three who tested positive are self-isolating at home.

Jerera is the commercial capital of Zaka and the outbreak of Covid-19 at the business centre comes as cases of the virus have been spiking in Masvingo province.
