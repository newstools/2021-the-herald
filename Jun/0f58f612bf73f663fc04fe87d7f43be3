ZIMBABWE captain, Knowledge Musona, has joined Saudi Arabian football club Al-Tain, ending speculation about his future. The 31-year-old forward was in the final year of his contract with Belgian giants, Anderlecht, who confirmed the move on their Twitter account. He will now play for a Saudi club which gained promotion, into the countryâ€™s top-flight league, at the end of last season. They finished third, in the second-tier league, securing the final slot for a place in the top-flight league. Musona had been heavily linked with a possible return to South Africa, amid reports that Kaizer Chiefs, Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns were all interested in his services. The Smiling Assassin had two spells at Chiefs, where he is a firm favourite of the fans of the Amakhosi. However, his agent, Mike Makaab, kept insisting none of the three South African clubs could afford Musona right now. A move to a cash-rich Saudi club certainly makes sense for Musona who might have considered that this could be his last major contract, in either Europe or the Middle East, and needed to go to a club which matches his financial requirements.
