To date, 78 868 bales of tobacco have been rejected with 22 211 bales rejected at the auction floors while 50 657 bales were rejected at the contract floors. This implies that rejection rates were lower at auction floors than contract floors. Tobacco is normally rejected for being mouldy, mixed hands and dirt. About 200 million kilogrammes of tobacco are expected this season. Last year farmers sold 186 million kg. This year’s tobacco selling season has been progressing well with most farmers generally happy with the payment modalities. However, the industry is implementing stringent regulations announced by the Government to curb the spread of Covoid-19 pandemic. Zimbabwe Commercial Farmers Union president, Dr Shadreck Makombe, urged farmers to continue following the Covid-19 regulations for their own sake and better health. “We encourage farmers to abide by the Covid-19 regulations for betterment of people’s health because we only have one life,” he said. Tobacco is one of the major foreign currency earners in Zimbabwe. The crop is now being produced through the contract system where farmers are given inputs and expert advice/ only a paltry of the crop is being produced by self-financed farmers. The increase in tobacco production saw a number of contractors.
