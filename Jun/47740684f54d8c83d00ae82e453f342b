The Herald Nyore Madzianike Senior Court Reporter The man who allegedly stabbed two competing touts in the row between competing bus crews in central Harare on Wednesday, killing one of them and seriously injuring another, has been arrested and appeared in court yesterday charged with murder and attempted murder. Munyaradzi Kambova of Mbare, was not asked to plead to the charges when he appeared before magistrate Mr Dennis Mangosi, who remanded him in custody to July 3. He was told only the High Court could grant bail for such a serious charge. The State led by Mr Anesu Chirenje alleges that the row started on Tuesday, the day before the stabbings. A CAG bus passed through Simon Vengai Muzenda Street bus terminus on its way to Honde Valley. At the bus terminus four passengers disembarked from a Bolt Cutter Bus and entered into the CAG bus. A fracas involving loaders of the two buses ensued before the CAG bus leaving the loaders still brawling. On the following day, another CAG bus loaded passengers at Mbare Musika and passed through the city centre to pick up more passengers along Robert Mugabe Road. Two Bolt Cutter buses blocked this CAG bus from loading, resulting in another brawl. The CAG driver managed to reverse his bus but there were people attempting to pull him off the bus. Upon realising that the fracas was getting out of hand, the CAG crew moved away from the scene, leaving Kambova, who is not employed by the bus company, according to the State. The court heard that the fracas continued, with Kambova and other marshals fighting. On realising that he was being overpowered, Kambova allegedly fetched out a knife and stabbed one of them on the chest resulting in his death. He allegedly went on to stab another one and fled. Kambova was arrested later on the same day while at a service station along Simon Mazorodze Road in Mbare.
