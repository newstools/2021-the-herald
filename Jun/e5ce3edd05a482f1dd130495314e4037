ZIMBABWE international footballers Thabani Kamusoko and Tafadzwa Rusike are in celebratory mode after lifting the MTN Super League title in Zambia with Zesco United. The Ndola-based club won the 2020/2021 league title with three games to spare following last Sunday’s 2-0 victory against Napsa Stars. The Warriors midfielders were part of the team which has now equaled the Zambian record of nine league titles, which was held by Mufulira Wanderers. Kamusoko joined the Zambian club in 2019 from Tanzania’s Young Africans. When Rusike joined Zesco last year in January, he declared that he was looking forward to winning trophies. “I am delighted to join this great football club and looking forward to winning trophies with them. Zesco United is a fantastic club that has dominated the Zambian league for some time now and they are one of the big teams in Africa. As such I am happy to join them,” said Rusike then While the Zimbabwean duo is celebrating it is not the same for their fellow countrymen at Nkana, who are still battling relegation. As they celebrated the league title, the Zimbabwean duo condemned fellow countryman Dennis Dauda’s team to another defeat. Dauda is in Napsa Stars books and fighting relegation with his team. The defeat left Napsa Stars on position 16 in the 18-team league. Dauda’s team has collected 36 points from 31 matches. One place above Napsa Stars are the champions Nkana, who are still fighting for survival in the top-flight league. Nkana is home to Zimbabwean quartet of Warriors’ goalkeeper Talbert Shumba, midfielder Tichaona Chipunza and defenders Kelvin Moyo, Jimmy Dzingai, and Takudzwa Chimwemwe.Over the weekend, they lost 3-2 away to Young Green Eagles.
They are 15th placed in the 18-team league with 37 points from 31 matches. Nkana have managed 11 wins.
