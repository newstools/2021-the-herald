The Herald Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter Dynamos…… (0)1 ZPC Kariba…. 0 DYNAMOS shot back to the top of Group A in the Chibuku Super Cup tournament after beating ZPC Kariba at the National Sports Stadium this afternoon. The Harare giants benefitted from a second half own-goal by ZPC Kariba defender, Collin Mujuru. Initially, the goal was attributed to DeMbare’s teenage sensation, Bill Antonio, whose shot was turned into the nets by the defender in the 56th minute. Dynamos maintained faith in the team that thrashed Yadah 4-0 in the previous match but they could not replicate the form. ZPC Kariba made one change after coach Godfrey Tamirepi replaced Paul Chiramba with Samuel Makawa. The changes however could not improve their fortunes in front of goal.Dynamos now have seven points from three games. ZPC Kariba are still winless with two points. DeMbare’s win set up the stage for the Harare Derby against CAPS United, who won their previous match to take on overnight lead of Group One, with five points. Teams:Dynamos: T. Mvula, E. Jalai, P.
