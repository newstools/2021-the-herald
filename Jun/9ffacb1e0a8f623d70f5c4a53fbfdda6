The Herald RIO DE JANEIRO — The Copa America has been rocked by one surprise after another, but there were none on Wednesday as Brazil coach Tite named his squad for the troubled tournament, led by superstar Neymar. The defending South American champions will keep a roster nearly identical to the one that beat both Ecuador and Paraguay 2-0 this month to extend the Selecao’s win streak in World Cup qualifying to six matches. Paris Saint-Germain striker Neymar, who missed Brazil’s 2019 Copa America win due to injury, will lead a squad with just one change: returning from injury, 36-year-old Chelsea defender Thiago Silva will replace Rodrigo Caio of Flamengo. There are two notable absences for the defending champions, both due to injury: Dani Alves of Sao Paulo, the captain of the 2019 squad, and Philippe Coutinho of Barcelona. The bigger question-marks hanging over the tournament, scheduled to open on Sunday when Brazil face Venezuela, are playing out off the pitch.
