A 26-year-old man has been arrested on allegations of robbing a schoolboy of his wristwatch yesterday while armed with a machete along Sherwood Road in Mabelreign, Harare. Leeroy Dhewa is alleged to have come across the boy while he was going to school before threatening him with a machete. He allegedly demanded the watch which the boy surrendered to him. His luck ran out when a motorist driving through the area was stopped by the boy and was informed about the incident. The boy jumped into the vehicle and they chased Dhewa who was still nearby. It is alleged that Dhewa then attempted to strike the motorist with a baseball bat but he was apprehended and surrendered to the police. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the incident and warned those walking around, hiding weapons and threatening the public that they will be arrested.
