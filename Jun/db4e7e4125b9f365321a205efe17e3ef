The Herald Crime Reporter The Zimbabwe Republic Police has expressed concern over a recorded increase in hit-and-run accidents countrywide. In a statement, police reiterated that drivers should stop after being involved in an accident. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said: “Police in Bulawayo are investigating a case of road traffic accident which occurred on June 1, 2021 at Khami Bridge, along Plumtree Road, where a female juvenile aged 12 was hit by an unknown motorist driving an unidentified motor vehicle. “The driver of the vehicle did not stop after the accident. The victim sustained serious head injuries and is admitted at Mpilo Hospital. Motorists are warned against fleeing from accident scenes,” he said. The whereabouts of the driver are still not known and police are still looking for him. Last month, a 29-year-old man was hit and killed by a Hino Sino truck at the intersection of Five Avenue and Sam Nujoma Street in Harare. The victim sustained head injuries and died upon admission at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals. On May 3, another 68-year-old pedestrian died after being hit by a Toyota Coaster along Bulawayo Road near Kuwadzana roundabout in Harare. On the same date, a woman aged 34 died on the spot after she was hit by a Nissan Caravan while trying to cross Mutare Road, near Mutangadura. Cases on hit and run accidents have been on the increase this year with some of the drivers being arrested and charged for culpable homicide while others are still at large.
