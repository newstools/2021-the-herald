The Herald Alec Masocha-Sports Reporter BLACK Rhinos coach, Herbert Maruwa, feels they face a tricky assignment when they take on Manica Diamonds, in the Chibuku Super Cup, at Sakubva this afternoon. The match is scheduled for 1pm. The army side are keen to return to winning ways, after their goalless draw against Cranborne Bullets, in Group Three. Maruwa wants his men to maintain high concentration levels even though the Gem Boys have lost, both their games, in this tournament. “They may have started badly but Manica Diamonds are dangerous as they are smarting from their defeat by Tenax,’’ said Maruwa. ‘‘Obviously, they will be out in full force, searching for nothing other than maximum points. I do not have any injury worries in my squad and all the players are ready for selection.” Rhinos are leading the group, with four points from two games, in which they hammered Tenax FC 4-1, in the opening match, before their goalless draw against their sister club. Bullets are second, in the race, with four points. They face Tenax, at the same venue, tomorrow.
