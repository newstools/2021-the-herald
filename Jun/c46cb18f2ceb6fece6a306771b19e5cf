The Herald Grace Chingoma Senior Sports Reporter CRANBORNE Bullets coach Nesbert “Yabo” Saruchera believes any team from their group is capable of progressing to the quarter-finals of the Chibuku Super Cup. Going into the second round of the round-robin matches, the newboys are on top of Group 3 which is based in Mutare. Bullets have five points followed by Black Rhinos and Tenax who both have four points. Manica Diamonds anchor the group with three points. In previous Chibuku Super Cup games, the army side managed a 1-0 victory against Manica Diamonds and had a goalless draw against their sister club Black Rhinos. Saruchera troops had to come from behind twice on Sunday to share the spoils in a 2-2 draw with fellow newboys Tenax at Sakubva. “The matches are a bit tough but we now know each other, so we will go back to the drawing board, rectify our mistakes and also counter on our opponents’ play. “We are new in the league but I am glad that in this Cup we are all equal, there are no favourites, anyone can proceed to the next round from our group,” said Saruchera. Saruchera concedes he still has to work on the defence which let in soft goals against Tenax. Bullets’ Everson Feremba scored a penalty before Malvin Hwata equlaised with few minutes before stoppage-time to claim a point after Tenax twice took the lead. “Our goalkeeper Tendai Makoni was the man-of-the-match. Our defence let us down but we managed to get back into the game. We will sort out the defence. We have some time before we resume the matches,” said Saruchera.
