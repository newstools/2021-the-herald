The Herald KHAMA BILLIAT is still battling for a return to full fitness and will not be risked into action when Kaizer Chiefs host Wydad Casablanca in a CAF Champions League decider at the FNB Stadium on Saturday. The Zimbabwe international last featured for the Amakhosi, on April 25, and has been on the treatment table, since then. Chiefs lead the Moroccan giants 1-0, after a shock win in Casablanca, in the first leg of their semi-final showdown, last weekend. Some analysts have dubbed it the Amakhosi’s biggest game, in their 51-year history, as they stand a chance of a first appearance, in the Champions League final. Chiefs’ progress, on the continent, has been in stark contrast to their challenges, on the domestic front. They had a miserable season, in which they even flirted with relegation, forcing the club’s leaders to part ways with coach, Gavin Hunt. Ironically, the Amakhosi are unbeaten, since Hunt was pushed out of the club. Billiat missed that match when the gallant Chiefs turned on a defensive masterclass, helped in a big way, by the heroics of goalkeeper, Bruce Bvuma. The Amakhosi ‘keeper turned on a vintage show, repelling everything which the hosts threw at him, in a performance which has been hailed by many analysts. Chiefs interim coach, Arthur Zwane, yesterday issued an update on the status of Billiat, Lebogang Manyama and Dumisani Zuma, ahead of their final showdown, against Wydad. “We won’t have Khama because he is coming back to fitness after having been out for a while now, so even in the second leg I don’t think he will be ready to compete at this level,” Zwane told reporters. – Sports Reporter/KickOff.com
