The Herald Conrad Mupesa Mashonaland West Bureau MASHONALAND West province will from tomorrow start the registration and subsequent verification of war veterans’ league members ahead of impending economic empowerment projects. The district officers that would ensure the registration and vetting processes go according to plan underwent an all-day-long induction workshop in Kadoma Tuesday. The workshop was addressed by Provincial Affairs and Devolution Minister Mary Mliswa-Chikoka, Veterans of the Struggle League board member, Cde Remigio Makoni and provincial war veterans’ chairperson, Cde Cornelius Muoni. “The registration process is expected to start this Thursday as all the seven administration districts have started collecting registration forms. “After registration, vetting will follow. Every member will be vetted at the areas that they operated from,” Cde Muoni said. Cde Makoni said the exercise, which seeks to register war collaborators, non and ex-combatants will also give access to the registration of war veterans and ex-political prisoners that were not registered. “Vetting will only be done to registered cadres and the exercise is going to take place across the country,” he said. Several empowerment projects, Minister Mliswa-Chikoka said, were lined up for the veterans of the struggle league.
