DANIEL Hondo-coached Zimbabwe national Sevens Rugby team, the Cheetahs, failed in their bid to qualify for the Tokyo Olympic Games after losing their three group matches in Monaco, France, at the weekend. The young side went into the competition with fewer expectations as the coach emphasised building a team for the future and fielded an inexperienced side and the result backfired. The Cheetahs had a bright start winning their first match of the World Rugby Sevens Repechage tournament when they defeated Mexico 21-0 and much was expected from the youthful side but they failed the test against two quality opponents Ireland and Samoa. The Cheetahs fell 31-10 to Ireland on Saturday morning and it went from bad to worse following a 33-7 defeat to Pacific giants Samoa in their last match of the day. On Sunday the Cheetahs faced Tonga in a game that had no relevance and they managed to win 26-17. Playing only for pride, the win was not good enough for Zimbabwe to progress to the next round of the Qualifiers.
