THE Warriors face a big challenge at this yearâ€™s COSAFA Cup where they have been drawn in the same group with west African football giants Senegal. The Lions of Teranga are set to make their debut in the tournament this year as a guest nation and were among the teams that were featured at the draw conducted today in South African port city of Port Elizabeth, now known as Gqeberha. The 12-team tournament will run from July 7 to 18 at Nelson Mandela Bay. One of the interesting highlights of the draw was when record six-time champions Zimbabwe were placed in Group C, headed by the Lions of Teranga. The other two teams in the group are Mozambique and Namibia. Senegal are the top-ranked side in Africa and are making their debut appearance in the COSAFA Cup competition after they received an invite from the organisers. The top team from each group advances to the semi-finals. They will be joined in the last four by the best second-placed teams from the three groups. Hosts South Africa are in Group A, which also has Lesotho, Eswatini and Botswana. Defending champions Zambia, who won the last edition in 2019, lead Group B and will face Malawi, Madagascar, and Comoros. COSAFA Cup draw
