The Herald Crime Reporter Police are concerned over a sudden increase in armed robbery cases at mining sites countrywide where criminals are targeting gold and cash. Heavily armed criminal gangs brandishing various weapons including guns and machetes have been attacking security guards in raids which usually occur during the night or early morning. Some of the suspects have been arrested while others are still at large. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the increase in such cases saying: “Police are concerned with occurrence of robbery cases at mine sites. On May 29, 2021 police in Kadoma arrested a suspect aged 18 for a robbery case which occurred on May 28, 2021 at Mupani Mine, in Kadoma. “The suspect and his two other accomplices who are still at large pounced on two victims aged 23 and 36 who were carrying out guard duties at the mine. “They tied the guards’ hands with shoe laces before assaulting one of the victims with a sjambok. They suspects stole various items including batteries, cement, a water pump and fuel,” he said. In another case, 20 suspects stormed D-Troop Mine in Chikuti, Chinhoyi on Saturday where they tied the hands and legs of guards manning the premises. The suspects disarmed the guards and stole a Mossberg shotgun with three rounds of ammunition, a cellphone and communication radio. They also stole 100 kgs of carbon containing gold and US$200.”   Since last year, cases of armed robberies have been on the rise, with businesspeople, mines and illegal money changers, being targeted across the country. Police in Shurugwi are hunting for four armed robbers who raided a mine on the outskirts of the town around midnight and got away with US$6 000 cash and a safe which was used to store gold. The armed robbers allegedly subdued five security guards after firing several shots into the air. They then tied the guards and assaulted them using logs and iron bars before they took the money and the safe.
