The Herald Columbus Mabika-Herald Reporter Government has bought 100 new vehicles for police and is now committed to building better housing in police camps and other cantonment areas as part of the review of the needs and working conditions of the security sector. Finance and Economic Development Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube told the National Assembly yesterday that the Government’s resourcing agenda roadmap for the security services had three areas: infrastructure and cantonment issues, logistics and transportation, and the salaries and general working conditions. On infrastructure; we have embarked on a programme for building houses, for building cantonment areas for the police. We have said we want to go around the country and try to document the sort of gaps that exist in the quality of infrastructure. Government has, in partnership with other entities, also embarked on a programme to clear the housing backlog in cantonments. On salaries, Prof Ncube said despite budget constraints, Government had been able to keep wages above the poverty datum line. “It is never easy. We always have budget constraints but we have tried to keep to that level. I think we have gone a long way in trying to upgrade the level of salaries and we will continue to do that,” he said. On logistics and transportation, Prof Ncube said Government had embarked on a vehicle acquisition programme, which has recently seen the delivery of 100 vehicles to the ZRP. On uniforms and boots, Government was able to clear the backlog in the last two years. Government is also supporting security facilities where they can sew up their uniforms but the idea is to support them with materials. Plans are also at an advanced stage for Government to provide incentives for community providers of security such as neighbourhood watch committees.
