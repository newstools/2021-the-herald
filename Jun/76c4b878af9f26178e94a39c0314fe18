Secondly, he is a national hero. It was not easy to always see condemned prisoners being hanged while he was a prison Chaplain. He would pray for them. “There was even a time when 15 year-olds would be subjected to the hangman’s noose. He assisted in saving President Mnangagwa from the hangman’s noose. “He also drove former President Mugabe and Edgar Tekere to cross the border into Mozambique to lead in the execution of the liberation struggle,” said VP Chiwenga. “Coming to the church, the songs that he composed helped pull people closer to God. He is now going to be with those whom he worked with and those that he helped through prayers.” VP Chiwenga said Father Ribeiro had a premonition of his death when he was admitted in hospital. “I am pleased to say I saw him during his last days in hospital saying he will not be able to come out alive and I said you can’t say this Father, but he said that was the situation. So I bade him goodbye. “He even directed people where he had left his laptop and other literature saying it would help in putting up the history of this country together that he was writing about,” he said. Head of Roman Catholic diocese for Harare, Archbishop Christopher Robert Ndlovu conducted yesterday’s mass before the body was taken to the national shrine for burial.
