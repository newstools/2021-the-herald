The Herald Ivan Zhakata-Court Correspondent A disgruntled woman has approached the Harare Civil Court seeking a peace order against a woman who is allegedly assaulting her for having an illicit affair with her husband. Blessing Nyamasvinga alleges that Kudakwashe Shereni is constantly beating her up and accusing her of snatching her husband. Nyamasvinga yesterday told magistrate Ms Meenal Narotam that Shereni was giving her no peace at her house as she was frequenting her residence causing havoc. “I want Kuda to be stopped from coming to my house and assaulting me. She also follows me in public and attacks me because I am having an affair with her husband. She is giving me no peace at my house as she is constantly coming and assaulting me. “Recently she came to my house armed with a steel bar, broke my door and destroyed my household property. Sometimes I will be forced to retaliate in self-defence. I have sustained a lot of injuries as a result of her assaults but I have not filed a police report because I thought we would work things out as adults,” she said. Nyamasvinga also told the court that Shereni scolds her using obscene words calling her a prostitute and a witch. Shereni refuted the allegations and told the court that she will be looking for her husband at Nyamasvinga’s house. “I went to her house following my husband whom she is having an affair with. I have never assaulted her but we have exchanged words on several occasions. “The reason why we end up insulting each other is she will be staying with my husband at her place and I will be going to her place to get my husband back. “I have never destroyed her property but I only removed the chain on the door which she was using to lock my husband in her house. “If this court grants her the peace order she is applying for, I am afraid that I may lose my husband,” she said. Ms Narotam granted the peace order and ordered Shereni to refrain from abusing Nyamasvinga in any way and live peacefully with her.
