A Chitungwiza man will languish in custody awaiting trial after the High Court rejected his appeal for bail pending trial on charges of attempting to obtain a passport using fictitious documents. Simon Muchemwa is facing fraud charges for allegedly trying to apply for a passport for one Cynara Tanaka Maxine Nyahoda using a forged passport application form and fake supporting documents. Nyahoda was purported to be in South Africa when in fact she was in the country. Muchemwa was last month denied bail at the Harare Magistrates’ Court, which ruled that there was a high risk of him fleeing the country. Justice Benjamin Chikowero upheld the lower court’s decision and threw away the appeal by Muchemwa for lack of merit.
