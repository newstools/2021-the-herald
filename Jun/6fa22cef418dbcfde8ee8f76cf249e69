The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Senior Sports Reporter WITH the preparations for the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games almost reaching the final phase, it has also been a time for some introspection on how the country has fared in the qualifying events. The rescheduled 2020 Olympic Games open on July 23. They are running until August 8. With the country most likely to field a small team of five athletes at the Games, Zimbabwe Olympic Committee chief executive, Stephen Mudawarima, believes they need to be more involved from the grassroots level. He said this will help in talent identification and supporting the identified young talent to become world class athletes that can produce podium performances at the Olympics. “We need to step back a bit remember even when I got in I said qualification should not be the ultimate goal. “I think part of what we need to try and do is to get a bit more involved in terms of identification of the talent in terms of long-term athletes development because there are no short-cuts to this. “We actually need to look at our long-term development, identify the talent at the right age and support it all the way through,” said Mudawarima. He said the target should be fielding quality athletes that win medals and not numbers without results. Apart from the support they get from the Olympic Solidarity that offers NOCs the opportunity to obtain financial and technical assistance for a limited number of elite athletes training and attempting qualification, he said they have to come up with their own resources to add on to that, so that they create a large pool of talent. “Right now we have six athletes on the scholarship but in my view it should be even up to 20 athletes on that scholarship, I think that improves the pool of talent,” said Mudawarima. At the Tokyo Games, Zimbabwe is looking at fielding athletes in rowing, athletics, golf and swimming.
