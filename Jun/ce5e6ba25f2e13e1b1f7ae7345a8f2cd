A 22-year-old man from Gokwe North was murdered after he allegedly approached one of the suspects claiming his newly married wife was pregnant by him. Midlands provincial police spokesperson Inspector Emmanuel Mahoko said Justice Chidhakwa had initially told one of the suspects, Joseph Muzenda, that he had just married a woman who was pregnant with his baby. Muzenda later teamed up with two other suspècts, Simbarashe Zikoke and Wellington Zharare, before stabbing Chidhakwa to death. “The suspects waylaid Chidhakwa along a footpath near Manoti Business Centre in Gokwe North on Sunday at around 7pm before confronting him for claiming that their friend, Joseph Muzenda, had married his pregnant girlfriend,” said Insp Mahoko. “Simbarashe Zikoke then grabbed Chidhakwa from the back, while Zharare stabbed him once on the left side of the chest and once on the leg with a knife. He died on the spot.”
