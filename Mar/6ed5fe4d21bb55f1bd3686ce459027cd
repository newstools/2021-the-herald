The Herald BEIJING. – China’s leading vaccine producer CanSino Biologics obtained the national drug regulator’s approval on Monday to start clinical trials of its latest recombinant COVID-19 vaccine (Adenovirus Type 5 Vector) in inhalation form. The Global Times learned that the vaccine, which was developed in cooperation with the Institute of Military Medicine under the Academy of Military Sciences, is no different in terms of virus species, cell banks, production technology or preparation formula from the company’s single-dose Ad5-nCoV COVID-19 vaccine, which is already in use – it just has an additional atomization inhalation device. The inhaled vaccine can stimulate an immune response in the mucous membranes of a person’s respiratory tract. This version is less painful and more accessible, especially for children andvulnerable people, experts said. The vaccine can be atomized into tiny particles in a device and then inhaled into the respiratory tract and lungs to stimulate mucosal immunity, said Beijing-based immunological expert. Research has confirmed that respiratory droplets and close contact are still the main transmission routes of the novel coronavirus. Mucosal immunity acts as the first barrier against the virus and is essential for the prevention of both mild and severe cases, Jiang Chunlai, a professor at Jilin University’s School of Life Sciences, said. – Global Times.
