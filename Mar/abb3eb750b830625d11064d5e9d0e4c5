ZAMBIA coach Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic has congratulated his Warriors counterpart Zdravko Logarusic after the latter secured a place at the 2021 African Cup of Nations football finals with a win over Botswana last Thursday. Micho, whose charges’ gallant come-from-behind 3-3 draw at home against Algeria on the same day fell short of qualification, is in the country for Chipolopolo’s dead rubber match against the Warriors at the National Sports Stadium tonight. And last night, Micho took time before his team’s training at the match venue to pose for photographs with Loga before congratulating the Croat. Loga qualified with a game to spare but he is not taking the game against Chipolopolo tonight lightly.
