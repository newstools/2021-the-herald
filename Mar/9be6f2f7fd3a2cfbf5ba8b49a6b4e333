The Herald Farirai Machivenyika Senior Reporter President Mnangagwa yesterday capped 65 graduates at the second graduation ceremony of the Zimbabwe National Defence University. The ceremony was supposed to be held last year but was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The graduates included 33 who did the National Defence Course, 20 who graduated with Masters’ degrees in International Studies and 12 who obtained Master of Science degrees in Software Engineering. In his address at the ceremony, ZNDU Vice Chancellor, Air Vice Marshall Michael Moyo said the institution was geared towards the provision of defence and security studies for the nation’s development. “In this regard and in line with its vision of being the nation’s defence and security hub fostering integrative and conscious nation building, the ZNDU is the pinnacle institution for defence and security studies,” he said. Air Vice Marshall Moyo said the institution now has three faculties; Engineering, Social Sciences and the Centre for Defence and Security Studies. He said the Faculty of Engineering had introduced two new programmes namely the Bachelor of Science in Aviation Sciences (Aircraft Systems and Operations) and Bachelor of Science in Aviation Sciences (Air Traffic Management). Other degree programmes in Electrical and Electronic Engineering and Mechanical Engineering are awaiting approval by the Zimbabwe Council for Higher and Tertiary Education. <img class="size-medium wp-image-537119 aligncenter" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Untitled-15.jpggrad-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="201" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Untitled-15.jpggrad-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Untitled-15.jpggrad.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> “The university has now opened its doors to non-military students in the faculties of Engineering and Social Sciences.
