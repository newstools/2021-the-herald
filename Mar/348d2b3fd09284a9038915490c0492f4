The Herald JOHANNESBURG – It looks like Kaizer Chiefs fans will have to wait a little longer to see the Zimbabwean striker Khama Billiat back in action again. Billiat has been out since January when he sustained an injury during Chiefs’ goalless draw against Stellenbosch FC and might only start playing from April. The 30-year-old has pulled out of the Zimbabwe squad to face Zambia and Botswana in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers later this month, as he looks to fully recover from the injury.
There was hope the Amakhosi forward would be back playing by now, but it has now been revealed that he will only start non-contact training on March 22. Billiat’s current contract with the Soweto giants has a one-year option at the end of the current campaign. Before the injury, the Zimbabwean had played 16 matches for the Glamour Boys, scoring once and creating a further five goals. – Agencies
