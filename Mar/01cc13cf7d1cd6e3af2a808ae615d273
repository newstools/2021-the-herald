The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo Senior Lifestyle Writer They say hair is life. Getting a good haircut is essential to looking stylish. One of the best things about the barbering community is that it is an industry absolutely overflowing with talent — all kinds of talent. In fact, getting a haircut is a lifestyle. Women always say their hair is the crown they are born with and they take care of it perfectly with some even spending a fortune to look beautiful. Men have joined the bandwagon now as their next best friend is a barber. Of late, there are so many talented barbers out there, who are crafting different hairstyles, especially on men. A survey by The Herald Lifestyle on Saturday revealed that many women trust men with darker deep wave hairstyles. Hair cutting is an art, once said United States rapper and business mogul P Diddy who is well known for the deep wave hairstyle. The trend has hit many men, from soccer guru Cristiano Ronaldo to David Beckham, you just don’t go wrong with a nice clean haircut. Along Churchill Road in Harare, there is a hair studio dubbed, “The Gentlemen’s Corner”. <img class="size-full wp-image-538965 aligncenter" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/2603-1-1-UNNAMED-13-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/2603-1-1-UNNAMED-13-1.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/2603-1-1-UNNAMED-13-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> It is a conspicuous bend, marked by its aura of affluence blending with its environs. From the sleek cars queuing around this place in the leafy area of Alexander Park, one can easily tell the nature of the clientele that frequents it for that gentlemanly touch. It may be that one may wonder what the attraction could be, since to some people a haircut is simply that: a haircut. Not the people who have been around this place. To them, getting one’s hair done goes beyond barbering: it is a way of life spurred on by passion and attitude. The style and technique. It wears a name, even. Well, to them that name is Mike Pabvabango. There really should be something in that name — Pabvabango. <img class="size-full wp-image-538967 aligncenter" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/2603-1-1-UNNAMED-14-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/2603-1-1-UNNAMED-14-1.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/2603-1-1-UNNAMED-14-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Herald Lifestyle on Saturday visited the place and caught up with Pabvabango, the founder of Gentlemen’s Corner, who shared his story, what makes him tick and how he has mastered the art of haircutting. From the start, the 34-year-old acclaimed celebrity barber who grew up in Shamva never dreamt that one day he will be the most sought after barber, yet alone shining in the posh suburb. “I came to Harare in 2004,” he said. “What happens is we grew up with a step mother and as you know life is a bit harder when you are staying with a stepmother, so to say. “So, my elder brother Paul Pabvabango decided we should find our own place, having a new life in Harare. It was very scary, arriving in the big city, like they say, a concrete jungle where dreams are made of and the lights will inspire you.” This made Pabvabango to look for quick avenues which could sustain his livelihood. Back in the village, Pabvabango was known as the best to cut hair for his friends and some family members. Then he thought about it — why not venture into the trade full time. “I became a barber in 2005 the following year after I relocated from the rural areas to Mabvuku, Harare,” said Pabvabango. “So, I was not working by then, I had a friend that I used to play with and he was my best friend. His name was Paul, we used to call him (Chikiri) or (Skills). At the opposite of his house was a small shopping centre and there was a barbershop owned by a man called Isaac. Fortunately, Isaac was looking for a barber and Skills told me to give it a try.” Pabvabango said he was even scared to give it a go, considering that it his first time not only in Harare, but also to practise his most loved trade — being a barber. “I had never cut anyone’s hair in Harare as I was a rural boy,” he said. “Most people looked down upon us, but that did not stop me. I gave it a go. To be honest, I never had any knowledge on how to cut the styles they wanted, but at school I was very good at art. “When I showed up for the job, I was asked to look for a random client from the streets to try my skills on and I passed the test. That was the beginning of my career. “I had to learn more and in 2008 I decided to move to the city centre for greener pastures and I got a job at Meikles Hotel. There was a barbershop and that is where I got the experience.” Asked how he came up with the name, “The Gentleman’s Corner,” Pabvabango said it was a suggestion by a client after he noticed how smart he was. “I am a suit person, even now, I put my barber’s apron on top of my designer suit,” he said while laughing. “One of my clients suggested the name “The Gentleman’s Corner” because he always called me gentleman because of how I looked. “I then adopted the name and since the barbershop was situated at a corner shop, I then used both gentleman and corner.” What then makes Pabvabango tick? “During the Covid-19 lockdown period, I had a service called Dial a haircut where people called and booked for their haircuts from home or offices,” he said. “Although I started that “Dial a haircut” in 2013, I think last year was my highest peak. I am popularly known for the spray on dye machine. I can even cover your forehead, baldness and those who love fake beard. “I am also famous for fiery haircuts as sometimes I use fire flames to cut hair. Not many know about flames as they can straighten hair, but there is a technique to do that.” Though Pabvabango said it was not the job he wanted at first, he managed to grab the opportunity bestowed on him by his friend. His clientele now ranges from all ages and races. <img class="size-full wp-image-538970 aligncenter" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/2603-1-1-UNNAMED-18-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/2603-1-1-UNNAMED-18-1.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/2603-1-1-UNNAMED-18-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “I do all types of hair from African hairstyle, Caucasian, Indian to Chinese,” said Pabvabango. “It was never my dream job, it was only the opportunity that I grabbed and turns out to be my career and I ended up loving the job and I enjoy cutting hair.” Besides being a strong member of Jehovah’s Witness Church, Pabvabango said the church has allowed him to showcase his creativeness by expressing his feelings. “I love my job,” he said. “I am one of Jehovha’s Witnesses and yes I’m allowed to do what I’m doing with no restrictions.” To date, Pabvabango has associated with some of the prominent and biggest celebrities in Zimbabwe. “I can’t share names of other prominent people I work with because it’s on contract bases,” he said. “But I have a handful of some of the top executives, chief executives and diplomats, among others. “I have been in the business for the past 16 years, I have so many heads I have given a haircut and some of those heads I never expected or dreamt of being their hair expert.” Pabvabango said he uses his creative mind in his job. “My client first books for my service,” he said. “Before we cut the hair, I discuss his style and what suits him best and then we agree and I do it. Sometimes some come with a particular style they would have seen on television, but I tell them it doesn’t suit them if it does not and ask them to try other styles I have.” Pabvabango attended Magadzi Primary School and Zvomanyanga Secondary in Shamva. He later moved to Mabvuku High School. <img class="size-full wp-image-538972" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/2603-1-1-UNNAMED-15-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/2603-1-1-UNNAMED-15-1.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/2603-1-1-UNNAMED-15-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mike Pabvabango with his family He stays in Zimre Park and is married to Abigal and the couple is blessed with two children.
