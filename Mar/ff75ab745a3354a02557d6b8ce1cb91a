PRESIDENT Mnangagwa has described the late Tanzanian President John Magufuli as a Pan-Africanist who worked tirelessly, not only to develop his country but the African continent as a whole. In a statement to Tanzania President Samia Suhuku Hassan, who has been sworn in this morning, the President said he “received with deep shock and sadness, the news of the passing on” of the late Cde Magufuli. “President Magufuli’s untimely death has robbed the people of Tanzania and the rest of the African continent of an exemplary Father and astute leader. The legacy of the late President Magufuli is not limited to his untiring efforts to promote development and peace in Tanzania but to the roles he played as a Pan-Africanist beyond the borders of his country,” said the President.
