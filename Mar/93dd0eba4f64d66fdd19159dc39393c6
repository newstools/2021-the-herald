The Herald DURBAN. — He is just 19, one of the rich kids of Durban, and owns a football club in South Africa, Royal AM. And, his coach, Floyd Mogale, has dismissed the notion that Andile Mpisane is getting preferential treatment, in the team, because he is the club chairman. Donning number 10, Mpisane sent social media into a frenzy, with silky skill,s during a league match against Uthongathi FC here recently. However, the teenager’s appearance, for his own team, has been met with some mixed feelings from certain quarters of the football fraternity, some of whom believe he doesn’t deserve to wear such a special number. However, his coach has defended his decision to pick Mpisane for their GladAfrica Championship games in recent times. “I don’t see him as a chairman but as a player [at training]. He is only 19 years old, the boy is happy, the boy loves football, he gives everything at training and deserves to play,” Mogale told KickOff.com. “I treat him as a player. I address him as a player. I have coached many players at development but I can tell you at 19 years he has football brains. His understanding of football is on another level. “When he is on the pitch, he is more like an assistant coach because of the way he understands football. We are still trying to work on his physical condition and it’s coming alright. “But I can tell you, he is a very good player and his understanding of football is another level for a 19-year-old youngster.” Mogale also revealed that former Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Kabelo Mahlasela is another high-profile star who is currently doing well at the club. “He is a player to take us to the PSL next season,” he adds. “He is a top professional both on and off the field.” — KickOff.com.
