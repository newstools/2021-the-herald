The Herald Empire detests any positive story coming from a former colony. Empire always craves for something dreadful to happen to a former colony like Zimbabwe for this justifies long colonialism. So, it comes as no surprise that at a time that Zimbabwe is almost turning the corner, Empire decides to renew economic sanctions. There is no doubt in any conscientious being that such a decision is always motivated by nothing, but racism. It is not convincing that Europeans care so much about us that they would go to lengths to protect our human rights. If this was true, then the liberation war would not have taken place. This is a basic truth that some would want to conveniently shrug off as bygones. So what has happened that seems to have riled Empire? As has become the norm, the signal always comes through the behaviour of the Empire’s lackeys. The henchmen always let the cat out. You see, Zimbabwe must not be allowed to live in peace and harmony. That is bad news to Empire because it would give ideas to other African countries. As small as the country is, its actions (embarking on an agrarian revolution) flies in the face of what should not happen to Africa as this would set a very bad precedence. As always, Empire’s lackeys start panicking when things begin to shape up in Zimbabwe. First, they predicted that Covid-19 was to give way to an Armageddon. The cataclysm did not happen and they then latched on to narrative that sought to discredit China and the Sinopharm vaccine. But this too failed. And now they have moved to discredit another beautiful story spreading like a wave across the country. The most beautiful story unfolding across the country, which even the dampest of the house niggas cannot fail to see is that of young black farmers literally taking the bull by its horns in making farming not just a professional career but the basis of employment creation.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-535578 aligncenter" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/1403-1-1-IMAGE-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/1403-1-1-IMAGE-1.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/1403-1-1-IMAGE-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> It is a beautiful story that is non-sponsored, non- political and is backed by a good season likely to usher in a bumper harvest for a variety of crops. It is a beautiful story spreading like a whirlwind where the zeal, passion, commitment and dedication of young black farmer is on display. It is a refreshing wind of change that has caught Empire and its local lackeys by surprise and are now resorting to all sorts of tactics to dampen its crescendo. The beauty of it all is that these young black farmers are from diverse backgrounds and across gender and they tearing into smithereens the stereotypical view of black farmers being incompetent and that land was only allocated to Zanu-PF elites. Young black farmers are showing the world that they can no longer be perpetual hewers of wood and drawers of water. They understand that freedom, independence and economic prosperity comes from owning the means of production. Gone are the days when young people used to shun farming in preference of white collar jobs in the city. The story of one Terence Maphosa is an inspirational one in that he is utilising the land at his rural home in Mhondoro-Ngezi to do wonders in poultry and crop farming. Maphosa is a graduate of the University of Zimbabwe’s Political Science department who decided to venture into agriculture out of passion. He markets his business online and judging by his followers, one can tell that the young has made a huge impact in his community and is an inspiration to many young people. And his words are profound. In an interview by one online publication Maphosa said: “A lot of youngsters are now appreciating farming, and slowly we are getting there. The reason why our generation doesn’t see farming as something lucrative is because of our background. When growing up, we were taught to go to school, to be doctors, to be nurses, to be lawyers, to be engineers, nobody pushed us to be farmers. A lot of youngsters are now appreciating farming, and slowly we are getting there.” Surely, it is understandable why Empire is piqued by this sort of summarisation. It clearly shows that Zimbabwe’s future is secured with the calibre of young people like Maphosa. But Maphosa is not alone in taking farming as a business. <img class="size-full wp-image-535580" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/1403-1-1-HUKU.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/1403-1-1-HUKU.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/1403-1-1-HUKU-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> This picture collage shows young Zimbabwean farmers who have taken the agricultural sector by storm, thanks to the Land Reform Programme Padorn Mhuri (35) of Karoi in Mashonaland West Province, is another young black farmer making waves in farming. Pardon recently scooped the National Young Champion Farmer award. After finishing his secondary education, Pardon first became a driver and later opened his own hardware. Pardon said the moment he managed to raise some money, he went to farming and this time, he was doing it as a business and not subsistence. He has been in farming since 2013. In his own words, Pardon said: “Farming has always been in my blood, but the major challenge was lack of capital. When I realised I had enough money to start farming, I went back to agriculture with a determined heart.” Pardon has diversified into horticulture and grows onions, tomatoes and cabbages among other crops. There is also the case of Samantha Emberton who was drawn into farming because she detested the idea of seeing truckloads of onions coming into Zimbabwe. She said these are crops that Zimbabwe should grow and urged young black women to venture into farming and play their part in ensuring food security for the country. These are indeed beautiful stories that we should tell and make a mockery of “jecha” politics. Let’s make a mockery of Empire’s antics to undermine our determination to chart our own destiny.
