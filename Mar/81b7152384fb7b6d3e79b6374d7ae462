The Herald DURBAN. – Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, who died on Friday, will be buried during a private night-time ceremony today. Only close male family members will be permitted to attend the funeral. The Zulu nation’s longest-reigning monarch succumbed to a Covid-19-related illness at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital in Durban where he had been admitted to the ICU for diabetes treatment a few weeks earlier. He was 72. As tributes poured in following the news of his death, the late king was hailed as a “champion for peace” a “custodian of Zulu traditions and customs” and a “much-loved visionary”. Initially, President Cyril Ramaphosa had afforded the king a Special Official Funeral Category 1.  But, in a statement, the traditional prime minister to the Zulu nation Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, confirmed that Zwelithini would be laid to rest in a private burial today. Buthelezi said the state funeral would instead be a memorial prayer service tomorrow. – DM.
