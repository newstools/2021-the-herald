The Herald Miami. — Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish won the top prizes at the Grammy Awards on Sunday in a ceremony that also saw Beyoncé become the most awarded female artiste in Grammy history. Swift’s surprise lockdown record “Folklore” was named album of the year and Eilish’s “Everything I Wanted” won record of the year. Sunday’s win made Swift, 31, the first woman to take home album of the year three times. Beyoncé’s four Grammys on Sunday took her total career wins to 28, surpassing the previous record for a woman set by bluegrass singer Alison Krauss. British singer Dua Lipa won best pop vocal album for her dance-y “Future Nostalgia.” The writers of “I Can’t Breathe” by R&B artiste HER won song of the year. It was written in response to the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States last summer. Rapper Megan Thee Stallion was named best new artiste and the 26 year-old known for promoting women’s empowerment won two more Grammys for her rap performance of single “Savage”, featuring Beyoncé. <img class="size-full wp-image-454412" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/TAYLOR-SWIFT.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/TAYLOR-SWIFT.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/TAYLOR-SWIFT-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Taylor Swift Hosted by Trevor Noah, the hybrid ceremony was packed with pre-recorded and live performances by the likes of Lipa, Taylor Swift, Post Malone, Cardi B, DaBaby, Black Pumas and Mickey Guyton.
