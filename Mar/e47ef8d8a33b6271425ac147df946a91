The Herald Tadious Manyepo in FRANCISTOWN, Botswana THE last time Warriors fans watched a live game, featuring their beloved team, was on November 19, 2019, at the National Heroes Stadium in Lusaka. Zimbabwe beat the hosts 2-1, in their 2021 AFCON qualifier, in a tough duel. The supporters came together to hire three luxury coaches, which ferried them to the Zambian capital. The fans won’t be able to cheer their team this evening, when the Warriors take on the Zebras, here in another Nations Cup qualifier. But, reports suggest a number of Zimbabwean fans will be in the vicinity of the stadium, supporting the team, even though they can’t enter the stadium. Zimbabwe National Soccer Supporters Association president, Chama Mushamaenza, said the Warriors should focus on getting a positive result. “It’s a shame we won’t be able to rally behind our Warriors, in Botswana, as we had planned,” he said. “Covid-19 has caused some damage to the sport. “But, the Warriors have to know that we are with them, when they play against Botswana. “We will have some fan clubs around the country. “We cannot be at the stadium but we are passionately appealing to the Warriors, to win the match against Botswana, for us.” The ZNSSA have since written a note to Warriors captain, Knowledge Musona, appealing to the skipper, and his troops, to turn on the style and win the match.
