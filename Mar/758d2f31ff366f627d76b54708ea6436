The Herald MAPUTO. – Mozambique’s military will soon start using Mi-17 and Mi-24 helicopters in the fight against insurgents in Cabo Delgado province as Dyck Advisory Group (DAG) private military contractors have their involvement reduced. This is according to Zitamar News, which reported that DAG is to end its involvement in the conflict on 6 April 2021. A well-placed source told Zitamar that DAG’s helicopter support would come to an end on 6 April, and from then on, air support would be provided by Mozambican military helicopters recently acquired from Paramount, and flown by Mozambican pilots trained by Paramount and its partner company, Burnham Global. DAG has used Gazelle, Alouette III and Jet Ranger helicopters in Mozambique. Zitamar sources told the news company that the Mozambican pilots would operate four Gazelle helicopters, while two Russian-made helicopters — an Mi-17 and an Mi-24 — would be operated by Ukrainian crews. Mozambique would be getting several upgraded Mi-17 and Mi-24 helicopters from Paramount, fitted with weapons, sensors and other equipment. While Mozambique has its own Mi-24 and Mi-17 helicopters, they are all understood to be grounded/unserviceable. Fifteen Mozambican pilots were being trained at the Paramount Technical Training Academy based at Polokwane International Airport. – Defenceweb.
