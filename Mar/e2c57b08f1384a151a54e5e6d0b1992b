The Herald George Maponga in Masvingo The National Arts Council of Zimbabwe has nudged Masvingo City Council and the Masvingo Arts and Theatre Club (MTAC) to smoke a peace pipe and find an amicable solution to the standoff over the famous Charles Austin Theatre. Council last week torched a storm after giving MTAC a three-month notice to vacate Charles Austin Theatre citing breach of contract. MTAC cried foul over the move accusing the local authority of trying to stifle growth of the fledgling arts and theatre sector in Masvingo. This prompted the National Arts Council to intervene and arbitrate. MTAC director Mr Charles Munganasa says there is light at the end of the tunnel after a breakthrough negotiated by National Arts Council. This was corroborated by Masvingo City town clerk Mr Edward Mukaratirwa who says rays of an amicable solution were filtering on the horizon. MTAC is famed for producing actors and script writers behind acclaimed films such “Operation Restore Legacy”, “Gonarezhou” and the upcoming “Mbuya Nehanda.”
