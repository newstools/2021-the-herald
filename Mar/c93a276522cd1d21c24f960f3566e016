The Herald Nyore Madzianike Senior Court Reporter A Harare man who admitted to conning the father of murdered Murehwa boy, Tapiwa Makore (7), of money to hire a car to Malawi to track the missing head of the deceased was yesterday granted $5 000 bail. Taurai Fitzgerald Mukumba, who is charged with fraud, is expected to return to court on March 25. Yesterday, Mukumba partially admitted to duping the late boy’s father, Mr Munyaradzi Makore of US$125 and $4 500 he had paid for hiring a car to travel to Malawi. Mukumba appeared before magistrate Mr Sheunesu Matova. He told Mr Matova that he failed to secure the car for Mr Makore because of the Covid-19 national lockdown regulations. <img class="size-full wp-image-535072" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Taurai-Fitzgerald-Mukumba.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Taurai-Fitzgerald-Mukumba.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Taurai-Fitzgerald-Mukumba-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Taurai Fitzgerald Mukumba runs away from the camera yesterday as he appears at Harare Magistrates Court on fraud charges for conning the father of the murdered Murehwa boy Tapiwa Makore. — Pictures: Lee Maidza “I was given the money to hire the car to travel to Malawi, but failed because of the lockdown,” he said. In September last year, Tapiwa was murdered and his body was later recovered with missing parts, including the head. Mr Makore then consulted traditional healers who told him that his son’s head was in Malawi and decided to travel there to track it. It was then that he hired Mukumba’s car. The court heard that Mukumba allegedly failed to hire out his car to Mr Makore, who then took the matter to the police. Mukumba was subsequently arrested and taken to court charged with fraud. Mr Lancelot Mutsokoti appeared for the State.
