Another land scam has sucked in MDC Alliance Chitungwiza Ward 12 councillor Darlington Musonza and the municipality’s housing director who were arrested by the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission over the weekend on criminal abuse of duty as public officers on allegations of duping a desperate home seeker of US$3 000. Allegations, according to the duo’s charge sheet are that sometime in April 2019, Mr Andrew Mhlanga visited Chitungwiza Municipality offices in a bid to acquire a residential stand and was advised to see Musonza who could assist. Musonza allegedly told Mr Mhlanga that he had several residential stands at his disposal which he received from council as a severance package and payment for his allowance arrears. He then allegedly offered a residential stand in Unit B Seke measuring 300 square metres valued at US$3 500. Mr Mhlanga then paid Musonza US$3 000 cash at Chitungwiza Municipality offices promising to pay the balance of US$500 later.
