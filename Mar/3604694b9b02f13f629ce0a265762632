A 63-year-old man was fined $40 000 after he was found guilty of destroying his former wife’s property that she left in their house upon separation in defiance of a High Court order that paved way for sharing of their matrimonial property. He was convicted of contempt of court. Edwin Matinyarare also risks being jailed for five months if he fails to pay the fine. Harare magistrate Mr Dennis Mangosi gave him up to April 20 this year to pay up. Mrs Shambadzeni Fungura, prosecuting, had it that sometime in September 2019 the High Court granted a decree of divorce order where Matinyarare’s wife, Dorothy Matinyarare, was the applicant. The order stated that each party would retain movable property which was in Matinyarare’s possession.
