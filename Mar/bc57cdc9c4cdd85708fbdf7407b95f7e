The Herald MADRIRD. — Vinicius Jr marked his 100th Real Madrid appearance, with a late equaliser against Real Sociedad, in a 1-1 draw in a Spanish La Liga match last night. Madrid dominated the first half with Mariano and Raphael Varane heading off the bar in the space of two minutes. Real Sociedad were much improved after the break and Portu scored an excellent header from Nacho Monreal’s cross. Zinedine Zidane changed his front three after 61 minutes and one of the replacements — Vinicius — finished from Lucas Vazquez’s cross late on. The draw brought to an end Madrid’s five-game winning run in all competitions and means they missed out on the chance to overtake Barcelona into second place. Real Sociedad remain in fifth place. Meanwhile, AC Milan striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic is set to be ruled out for up to three weeks with a left thigh injury, meaning he will miss the Europa League tie against former side Manchester United. The 39-year-old, who scored 29 goals in 53 games for United, was substituted in the 56th minute of Milan’s 2-1 win over Roma on Sunday. The two legs of the last-16 tie are due to be played on 11 and 18 March. The Swede has scored 16 goals in 21 games this campaign. AC Milan are second in Serie A, four points behind rivals Inter Milan. — BBC Sport.
