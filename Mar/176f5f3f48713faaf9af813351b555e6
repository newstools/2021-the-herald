The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter AFTER trying his luck with Black Rhinos, during the 2018 football season, Tawanda Mhike has not lost hope of playing in the top-flight. The 22-year-old, who spent the season training with the army side, despite not having been registered, later settled to play for ZIFA Eastern Region Division One side, Surrey Abattoirs. Mhike, believes the return of football, in the country, gives him hope as he wants to make a name for himself. The Ruwa-based towering defender said his wish is to play in the top-flight league, at some point, and probably even graduate to play in clubs outside the country. “I am happy that there seems to be light, at the end of the tunnel, after a long time, without our favourite sport,’’ he said. “I have been training at home, going through some road runs, and it has kept me in shape. “It is my wish to play at the top level and I gave my time to lower leagues so that I gain the much-needed experience.’’ The versatile player, who can also play as a right-back and central defender, began his career in the Midlands capital, Gweru, with 13 Stars. He then moved to the capital, to pursue his dream. Former Premiership player, Charles Mutero, who is in charge of Surrey Abattoirs, spoke highly of the player. “I think, given an opportunity, he will reach great heights, it is unfortunate that we lost most of the time due to the lockdown,’’ said Mutero. “But, we are happy that there is a chance that the sport will resume anytime soon.’’
