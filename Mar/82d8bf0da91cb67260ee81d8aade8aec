The Herald Senior Court Reporter NORTON legislator, Temba Mliswa, accused of violating Covid-19 national lockdown regulations after calling a media conference at his Borrowdale residence in Harare, is on Monday expected to challenge his placement on remand and request for relaxation of his bail conditions. Mliswa yesterday gave the notification to the State when he appeared before Harare magistrate Mr Sheunesu Matova for his routine remand. He said he wanted to make the application yesterday but decided to defer it to Monday when his lawyer Mr Musindo Hungwe will be available. Mliswa was released on $20 000 bail and ordered not convene any media conference until his matter is finalised. He was also ordered to report once a week at Borrowdale Police Station. The State alleges that sometime in February this year Mliswa called a media conference at his house where 22 journalists attended. Police went to Mliswaâ€™s house and found him about to field questions from the journalists.
