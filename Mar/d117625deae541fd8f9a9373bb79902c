The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter DINDINGWE is proving to be a force to reckon with after she romped to victory at the Zimbabwe Guineas Grade Three race at Borrowdale Park on Sunday afternoon. Coming into the race, the runner was one of the favourites after she outclassed other competitors in the previous races. Apprentice Rodgers Satombo steered her to victory in the Champion Juvenile Stakes, the Breeders Fillies Mile and, recently, the first leg of Zimbabwe’s Triple Tiara, Fillies Classic. Dindingwe retained the upper hand, against arch-rival True Beauty, who stood gallantly in defeat, as she tried her best, with Kevin Derere as the pilot. The Zimbabwe Guineas is the first race of the Triple Crown and was shown live on DStv’s racing platforms. Dindingwe will be expected to maintain the fine form, and win the last two races, to join a group of best runners, who have won the Tripple Crown, at Borrowdale Park. It was Zimbabwe’s top two three-year-olds, Dindingwe and her stablemate True Beauty, who provided a thrilling finish in the feature race of the day. <img class="size-full wp-image-537541" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Horse2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Horse2.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Horse2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Peacable , riding for Bridget Stidolph, after having taken the 1800m Maiden Plate — Pictures by Zim Equine News. Dindingwe held on, in a tough race, with True Beauty closing in, very fast.
