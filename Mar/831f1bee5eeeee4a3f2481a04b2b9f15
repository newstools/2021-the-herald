The Herald Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter KENT Cricket have signed promising Zimbabwe-born cricketer Tawanda Muyeye on a three-year contract. The 20-year-old sport scholar at Eastbourne College was named Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year for 2020 and had several other offers on the table. “I am delighted to sign for Kent and achieve my dream of becoming a professional cricketer,” he told the club’s media. Muyeye broke two scoring records at Eastbourne in his first year, hitting 1,112 runs at an average of 69.50 for the season, with 56 sixes. He also scored two double hundreds, his second coming from only 135 deliveries. He is also a useful off-spinner. The Wisen Schools Cricketer of the Year award has gone to some notable players, including England stars Jonny Bairstow and Jos Buttler. Kent’s new vice-captain Daniel Bell-Drummond has also received the accolade. Following his award, the Zimbabwe-born player, who qualifies as a domestic player, was described as one “of immense presence, a batsman destined to empty bars and “the best off-spinner of his age group in the county.” He’s been at Eastbourne College under the mentorship of former Kent stars Rob Ferley and James Tredwell. Kent captain Sam Billings was delighted with the new signing. “Absolutely delighted. Very exciting young talent and an impressive young man who will offer so much to our group on and off the pitch. Very exciting times at Kent Cricket,” said Billings. Director of cricket at Kent, Paul Downton, added: “We are really excited that Tawanda has agreed to join us at Kent. He had several offers from other counties and was in high demand. “As he begins his journey as a professional cricketer, we aim to help him develop as a person and as a cricketer, and to help him fulfil the huge potential he undoubtedly possesses.”
