ZIMBABWE Rugby Union believes the reassignment of its president, Aaron Jani, to chair Rugby Africa’s Performance subcommittee will help the local game. ZRU media personnel Simba Danga said the appointment is a good move for the country and it shows how Rugby Africa has faith in Zimbabwean administrators. “Rugby Africa has shown faith in our administrators as shown by the on-going appointments of our ocal administrators. We are hopeful that this appointment will go a long way in improving the local game. “I think this will enhance the country’s influence on the Performance sub-committee, which has the Nations competing for the right to represent Africa in the 2023 World Cup,” said Danga. In November last year, Jani was appointed as an executive committee member of the Rugby Africa’s women advisory committee, whose role is to shape the future of the women’s game on the African continent. Jani’s latest appointment comes after ZRU board members, Abigail Mnikwa and Abigail Kawonza were recently assigned roles on the Rugby Africa subcommittees for women. Mnikwa was named in the Rugby Africa’s women rugby advisory committee’s subcommittee on leadership, training and conferences.
