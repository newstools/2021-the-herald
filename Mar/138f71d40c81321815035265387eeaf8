The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter ALL is set for the annual Easter Chess Open Championships, to be held virtually, during the upcoming holiday. Chess players who have already hit the ground by running a league, have called on participants to register in time, so that they can be accommodated for the championships. Zimbabwe Chess Federation secretary-general, Todd Mapingire, said they could barely wait for the tournament after almost a year of inactivity. “The ZCF annual traditional Easter tournament is back after a year off the radar,’’ said Mapinge. “The 2021 Easter tournament is unique as it is being held in a Covid-19 induced lockdown period. “The participants will be limited, per all sections available, due to Covid-19 regulations.’’ ZCF have already got their league running after they managed to secure some sponsors, and an office, from where they are conducting their business, in Harare’s central business district. “May I thank the sponsors, and those who co-ordinated the logistics of the tournament, to be made possible. “The ZCF Covid-19 regulations are to be adhered to before, during and after the tournament,’’ said Mapingire.
