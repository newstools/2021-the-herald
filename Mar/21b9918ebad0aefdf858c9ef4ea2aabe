The Herald LUSAKA – Bruised and battered Zambian football giants Nkana have added Zimbabwean defensive midfielder Tichaona Chipunza to their ranks as coach Kelvin Kaindu seeks to stabilise his sinking ship. The Zambia Super League defending champions, Nkana, have been at their lowest both in their domestic league as well as the Caf Confederations Cup group phase, where they are struggling for form. On the domestic front, the Kitwe-based side are in the murky waters of relegation, on 16th position with a paltry 20 points on their tally after 17 rounds of matches. They, however, have four games in hand which they hope to utilise to redeem themselves for the precarious position they find themselves in. And the new addition, Chipunza, is keen on helping them swiftly move out the drop zone before it’s too late. “I am so happy to join a big team not only in Zambia but in Africa. Nkana has such rich history and it is one of the biggest teams on the continent. “My expectations are that we are going to give it our best as a team because I am a team player. “I expect to win things for Nkana and supporters will definitely see good performances from me,” he said. The former Dynamos and Ngezi Platinum anchorman becomes the fifth Zimbabwean to join Nkana after goalkeeper Talbert Shumba, Jimmy Dzingai, Takudzwa Chimwemwe and Kelvin Moyo who have already established themselves at the club. – Panafricanfootball.com
