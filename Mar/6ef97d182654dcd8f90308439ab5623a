The Herald Senior Court Reporter MDC-Alliance activist Makomborero Haruzivishe was not honest when he tried to explain why he failed to attend his hearings on criminal charges sometime last year and so forfeits his bail and must be remanded in custody. In a ruling on the enquiry into why he defaulted on returning to court on the remand date, read on her behalf by magistrate Mr Sheunesu Matova, Harare provincial magistrate Mrs Vongai Guwuriro said Haruzivishe failed to give a plausible defence on why he defaulted court. Haruzivishe is being charged with participating in a public gathering with intent to cause public violence. After his explanation was rejected, he was remanded in custody to March 16. Mrs Guwuriro also denied bail another activist, Takudzwa Godfrey Ngadziore, saying he exhibited propensity to commit further offences since he was already on bail over three similar cases still pending in the courts. In denying him bail, Mrs Guwuriro said Ngadziore’s accomplices were still at large and he was likely to team up with them and commit more offences. “It is clear that the offences have an element of violence and were committed at a public place. He needs to do more explanations so that if granted bail, he will not commit further offences,” said Mrs Guwuriro in her ruling. However, Mrs Guwuriro granted $5 000 bail to Ngadziore’s co-accused, Tapiwanashe Chiriga as the State had failed to convince the court that Chiriga was not a proper candidate for bail. The two are expected back in court on March 18.
