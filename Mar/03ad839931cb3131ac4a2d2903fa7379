The Herald Nyore Madzianike Senior Court Reporter A local manufacturing company, Tregers Products Limited, was duped of over $8 million by its two employees who manufactured documents purporting to have had hired different transporters to ferry its wares around the country. Abisha Marijena and Alfred Piason, who were employed as logistics clerk and logistics supervisor respectively, appeared at the Harare Magistrates Court charged with fraud. They were not asked to plead to the charges when they appeared before magistrate Ms Tafadzwa Miti who remanded them to April 6 on $10 000 bail. The State had it that the duo was supposed to hire and pay private transporters to carry Tregers’ goods around the country. It is said from November last year to January this year, the two hatched plans to defraud their employer and started falsifying invoices paid to different transporters. Marijeni and Piason are said to have falsified documents saying they had hired three companies — Spearhead Logistics, Sageroad Enterprises and Wise Jack Logistics — to carry goods around the country. It is alleged they duplicated a company invoice with $3 142 025 for goods that were supposed to be delivered to Lobels Company in Southerton, Harare. The duo allegedly indicated that the products were delivered to Chiredzi, Kariba, Hauna, Checheche, Chipinge and Chivi. Allegations are that Tregers Products paid various amounts based on the duplicate invoice for services provided to the aforementioned destinations. The offence came to light when the manufacturing company reconciled its books and discovered it had been prejudiced of $8 350 000.
