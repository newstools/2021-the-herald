The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE representatives, at this year’s rescheduled Africa Volleyball Club Championships, University of Zimbabwe Wolves, are running out of time. The tournament is set for next month. UZ Wolves won the slot, at the Zone VI games in Lilongwe in 2019, and were supposed to have participated in the Club Championships last in April, before the Covid-19 lockdown. The tournament, which was scheduled for Tunisia, has now been rescheduled for March 31 to April 7. Wolves were already in the second week, of camp, when the Covid-19 lockdown strike. Zimbabwe Volleyball Association secretary-general, Kenneth Kondo, said the team were running out of preparation time, as the sport was still regarded, as a high risk code. Kondo said the team were relying on online training sessions. “We are in a fix and we will this week submit our submissions to the Sports Commission. “We are happy that the individuals are following the training programmes religiously,” said Kondo. The UZ Wolves were supposed to be joined by Harare City, who finished second at the Zone VI qualifying tournament.
