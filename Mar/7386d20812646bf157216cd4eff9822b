The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo Senior Arts Reporter The wait is over! All is set for the 2021 National Arts Merit Awards (NAMAs) ceremony tomorrow, which will be held virtually under the Covid-19 pandemic regulations and will run under the theme “Our Legacy, Our Pride”. The awards will honour 40 arts legends and celebrate Zimbabwe’s 40th anniversary, as well as the 35 years of the National Arts Council (NAC)’s existence. The event, which will be beamed live on ZBC, will also be streamed on Zimpapers Television Network (ZTN) and the NAMA social media page, will be hosted by songstress Ammara Brown. With performances from Zimdancehall sensation Poptain, Nutty O, Anita Jaxson, Busi Ncube, ExQ, DJ Tamuka and Tammy Moyo. <img class="size-full wp-image-538222" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/EX-Q.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/EX-Q.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/EX-Q-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> EX Q Another set of artistes is set to make an appearance and perform from the Diaspora. The list, which has been described as “a first and rare occurrence collaboration — the ‘Big Diaspora Collaboration”, will see seven artistes in different countries coming together on one track. The musicians include Bekezela (SA), Brian Nhira (USA), Cindy Munyavi (USA), Sani Makhalima (Australia), Tina Masawi (Spain), Vimbai Zimuto (Netherlands) and Vusa Mkhaya (Austria). NAMA executive director and producer, Napoleon Nyanhi, said Zimbabwe exported a lot of brilliant talent. “At NAMA, we will celebrate with some of our best musical exports from different countries, Zimbabweans who are making it abroad. We have the talent and this is how best we can appreciate them and show to the world the stuff they are made off.” Jacaranda Culture and Media Corporation’s Tinashe Kitchen said, “Our aim is to celebrate our artistes who are flying the Zimbabwean flag high all over the world. Just like the legends we will honour this year, they continue to inspire and make us proud to be Zimbabwean through their art and majesty. “One of the NAMA mandates is to expose Zimbabwean talent to the world and the Big Diaspora Collaboration serves to herald Zimbabwe’s dominance beyond our borders.” Last year, the NAMA show had an electric opening performance with a remix of the song “Ngaibake”. The performance featured Alick Macheso, Freeman, Ammara Brown and TiGonzi, and had the whole auditorium on its feet. With Ammara Brown as their choice for hosting the awards this year, the songstress can set the show ablaze considering that she is a versatile musician, dancer and actor. The NAMAs are Zimbabwe’s own the Oscars, the prestigious American show which covers music, dance and theatre. This year there is an absence of the red carpet which most fashionistas, celebrities, artistes and socialites would love to walk down, showcasing their garments and power suits. It was going to bring more excitement if it had incorporated the red carpet affair virtually, just like what happened on the Golden Globe awards ceremony recently. Yes, with some of our local fashionistas who are craving to be seen out there because there was no activity for almost a year, some are sure that they would do whatever it takes to appear on the virtual show. “We could have dressed up for the occasion at our houses while watching the show and then they have multiple screens which show our footage, what we are wearing,” said one fashionista identified as Tarry MK of HL Classique. “This year is about virtual, we can still do the interviews via Skype too. Maybe they thought that was not necessary, but for awards to have a spark, they need a fashion factor.” Again, this year there are no nominees as the NAMAs are honouring selected 40 legends in the arts sector who hogged the limelight over the past 35 years.
