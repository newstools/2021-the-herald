The Herald Zvamaida Murwira Senior Reporter Civil servants who fail to report for work will lose pay for missing days, the Public Service Commission said yesterday, but the next round of negotiations for cost of living adjustments starts today. In a statement, Secretary for Public Service Commission Ambassador Jonathan Wutawunashe said discussions between Government representatives and civil servants will focus on cost of living adjustment and other issues that are pertinent to the welfare of civil servants. “Government is pleased to confirm that the meeting between workers’ representatives and the Government team in the National Joint Negotiating Council is scheduled for 12 March 2021,” he said. “The meeting will deliberate on a cost of living adjustment and other matters that relate to the welfare of civil servants. Government is satisfied that preparations for the opening of schools are proceeding well. “All civil servants who have been called to work are expected to report at their work stations on the date they are scheduled to commence work. “Government will apply the principle of no work no pay in respect of civil servants who absent themselves from work, a principle that is fair to clients who are entitled to services, as well as to those civil servants who report for work.” Ambassador Wutawunashe reiterated Government’s commitment to continuous and fruitful engagement with its workers towards improving conditions of service for its valued workforce.
