Police’s Mashonaland West provincial armoury officer-in-charge, Clive Kadambure has been arrested in connection with a case in which two men were arrested at Sango Border Post trying to smuggle firearms. Police arrested the two and recovered six firearms at Gonarezhou National Park as they were trying to smuggle them to Mozambique through Sango Border Post on March 15. Kadambure, who was arrested last Tuesday, is in custody after being denied bail. He is jointly charged with his wife, Shyness Kadambure, a teacher at Alaska Primary School in Chinhoyi. According to State papers, Shyness buried Kadambure’s CZ service pistol and 58 x .375 Honardy Ruger ammunition rounds at the couple’s Hunyani Infil house garden. “Accused persons’ possession of ammunition on its own should be treated as serious considering the circumstances leading to the recovery of the ammunition,” read the State papers. “Accused one is being linked to the recovered six automatic rifles at Sango Border Post in Mwenezi, Masvingo, where an investigation is in progress under ZRP Mwenezi CR 57 l/03/21 and CID Mwenezi DR 18/03/21.”
