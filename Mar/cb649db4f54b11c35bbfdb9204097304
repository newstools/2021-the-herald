The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — Kaizer Chiefs have gone to a two-week break from domestic football celebrating their Soweto Derby victory but with plenty of red lights flashing about their attack. The top goalscrorer for Amakhosi only has three goals after almost two thirds of league football already played, with the team uncharacteristically having scored fewer goals than they have conceded. Chiefs have played 19 league games but the men who should be providing goals playing as attacking midfielders and up front have depressing numbers. Leonardo Castro is the leading scorer with three and what is concerning is that those goals came in two matches — two against Golden Arrows in the fourth league match and then one a month ago — having played 16 league games. Also on three league goals is Lebogang Manyama, who operates as an attacking midfielder and has played 15 league games. Rising star Nkosingiphile Ngcobo’s three goals also mean he is joint-top scorer — which sounds encouraging for a midfielder still considered an infant at this level of the professional game. Samir Nurkovic’s winner in the Derby was only his second this term following a difficult start to the season that saw the club turn down offers for him to leave in between shrugging off injury discomforts. Two goals in 11 appearances for the main striker is a reflection of just how Chiefs have struggled as Nurkovic has scored as many league goals as Happy Mashiane, who scored in consecutive games in January. This means only five players have scored more than once for Chiefs in the league after 19 games of this campaign. Bernard Parker’s goal drought has continued as he is yet to score this term just like Lazarous Kambole and Dumisani Zuma, who all play in attacking positions. Injured star man Khama Billiat only has one goal to show from nine league appearances this season. The Zimbabwean just hasn’t had the best of times through all of his three years at Chiefs. — KickOff.com
