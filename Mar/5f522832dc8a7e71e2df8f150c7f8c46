The Herald Pretoria. — When Sowetan columnist and relationship guru Phindi Grootboom told her husband that she was entering the Mrs SA pageant, he was quite surprised. “When I first told my husband he gave me a blank stare. I think it’s because people think of the usual and traditional pageants where women wear swimsuits,” she chuckled. The 44-year-old, who was a semifinalist in the pageant and women empowerment programme held last week, said she wanted to show her daughters that they are capable of anything; and that weight and height should not be a deterrent to believing they are beautiful. “I want my kids to know there are no limitations. I am 44 and I can still enter a pageant. It was also very important to me to break barriers that I put up for myself and not just barriers that society puts on me,” she said. Grootboom said Mrs SA allowed like-minded women who are passionate to congregate and create long-lasting connections which will be valuable to her in future. “Women empowerment is very close to my heart and being a mother of two girls I want to raise them a certain way and be a good role model to them,” said Grootboom. She said the Covid-19 pandemic made her realise that life was too short to have regrets about not fulfilling her dreams. “Covid-19 made me realise life is too short and that I should not waste my time and not do things that will fulfil me. We all have lost people who are dear to us and life is shorter than we think,” she said. Grootboom said as a relationship counsellor she also knew the importance of women taking time to do things that are important to them and only for them. “It feels good to do something that only focuses on you. This has been a life-changing and personal journey that has changed how I view myself,” she said. The winner of Mrs SA 2021 is Thenjiwe Mdluli. — Sowetan.
