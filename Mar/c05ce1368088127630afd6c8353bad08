The Herald N’DJAMENA. — The Sports Ministry of Chad have dissolved the Federation of Chad Football Associations, which could led to the country being thrown from world football, by FIFA. In December, the FFA ignored a previous request from the ministry, regarding a provisional withdrawal of its mandate. This time the ministry suspended the mandate on Wednesday. In Group A of the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, Chad can no longer progress to the continental finals. They are due to play both Namibia and Mali, in the final round of fixtures at the end of this month, but those matches are now in doubt. A statement from the ministry, which was seen by Goal.com, reveals that the responsibilities, and powers of the Chad Football Associations Federation, have been taken off them, in the latest step in an ongoing dispute between the organisation and the government. “By the definitive withdrawal of this delegation of powers, it is formally forbidden for the (Ftfa) to participate in the various international meetings,” the statement began, “and to organise or participate in any other national or international competition or event on behalf of Chad.” The context for this decision is a disagreement between both parties and the ministry’s recent request to withdraw — albeit on a provisional basis — the federation’s powers. The decree prevented Chad from taking any part in yesterday’s CAF Ordinary General Assembly in Rabat, Morocco. Recently, the likes of the Sierra Leone federation have fallen foul of these guidelines and had to serve a suspension, and Chad now risk a global ban of their own. It remains to be seen whether any potential ban will be in place ahead of Chad’s upcoming AFCON qualifiers later this month. — Goal.com/insideworldfootball.com
