Speaking during a meeting this Saturday, Makonde DCC chairperson and Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Deputy Minister, Cde Kindness Paradza said the five million target was achievable. The organ, he said, had laid out a plan to recruit more voters in all the three constituencies in the district. “DCC leadership will start visiting all the party districts in Mhangura, Makonde and Chinhoyi constituencies. “We are also going to propel voter registration so that President Mnangagwa and the entire ruling party win resoundingly,” he said. The party also seeks to reclaim Chinhoyi constituency seat and council seats lost to the opposition party. <img class="size-full wp-image-537186" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/DCC2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/DCC2.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/DCC2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Zanu PF Makonde District Coordinating Committee (DCC) Addressing the members politburo member, Cde Douglas Mombeshora condemned misuse of socail media.
