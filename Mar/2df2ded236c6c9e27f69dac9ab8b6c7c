The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Chess Federation will tomorrow hold their annual meeting, as they seek to resume their official activities, in the coming weeks. The association were one of the sports codes, which were given the greenlight to resume, as they are deemed low-risk disciplines. The ZCF executive, led by Collins Tongowona, have been conducting their games virtually, during the Covid-19 lockdown. Their indaba will focus on several aspects, including the document they will submit to the Sports Commission, for them to start official matches. The virtual system helped Team Zimbabwe prepare for the Chess Olympiad, and Africa Chess Championships, whose dates are yet to be announced. There is also the Chess Olympiad, slated for Russia in August. Tongowona highlighted the importance, of utilising the internet, to conduct their training programmes, ahead of the forthcoming major events, on the chess calendar. “We are now able to conduct some tournaments, on a weekly basis, ever since we took part in the Paralympics Games, and the Memorial Tournament. “We have adopted the online playing system, where our players will be practicing not only for the major tournaments, but also for the first ever professional league, which is set to get underway,” said Tongowona. The International Chess Federation, and the Africa Chess Confederation, suspended all activities, in line with the World Health Organisation guidelines, after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The ZCF are scheduled to send an eight-member team to Russia, for the Chess Olympiad, should they be given the greenlight, by authorities. It also remains to be seen whether the tourney will be held as scheduled.
