Zimbabwe’s Warriors moved closer to qualification, for their third straight AFCON finals, with a 1-0 win over Botswana in Francistown tonight. Forward Perfect Chikwende scored the priceless goal, in the first half, to take the Warriors to eight points, on the table, two behind African champions, Algeria. The result means coach Zdravko Logarusic’s men can qualify for the Nations Cup finals, should the Zambians fail to beat the Desert Foxes, later tonight. In the event Zambia win that game, the stage will be set for a final showdown, for a ticket to Cameroon next January, when the Warriors host Chipolopolo at the National Sports Stadium in Harare on Monday night. Botswana, however, are now out of the running for a place at the Nations Cup finals.
