We are uniting our people and ensuring that economic, social and political opportunities are spread across the country, leaving no one and no place behind,” said President Mnangagwa. “Zimbabwe, under my administration, continues on a sure path towards a sound legislative environment and building strong national, accountable, transparent and responsive institutions that must transcend generations.” He briefed the heads of mission of what the Government is doing in fighting the Covid19 pandemic.
