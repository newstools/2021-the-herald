The Herald BUDAPEST. — Pep Guardiola admits he has felt under pressure to win the Champions League title since becoming Manchester City manager. His club qualified for the quarter-finals for a fourth successive year on Tuesday night. The English Premier League leaders sealed a 4-0 aggregate win against Borussia Moenchengladbach in Budapest after a 2-0 victory in the second leg, courtesy of goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Ilkay Gundogan. The Champions League is the one major prize that has eluded Guardiola since he arrived at the Etihad in 2016. “Since the first year I arrived they told me that you have to win the Champions League,” said the City boss, who won Europe’s elite club competition twice as Barcelona manager. “It is always on our shoulders but I’m not concerned about that. If you deserve it in football, you go through. If you don’t, you don’t.” City, who have never been crowned European champions, are chasing an unprecedented quadruple in the current campaign. They look almost certain to win a third English Premier League title in four seasons, face Everton in the FA Cup quarter-finals on Saturday and play Tottenham in the final of the League Cup in April. “I’m more than incredibly impressed and delighted for our players in this tough year for everyone in society,” said Guardiola. “Being 14 points clear in the Premier League, in the final of the League Cup, quarter-final of the Champions League and going to play to get to the semi-finals of the FA Cup. “This is more than winning one quarter-final or one last-16 game. It means that in nine to 10 months, every three days, you are there — and this is the best title you can get. — AFP.
