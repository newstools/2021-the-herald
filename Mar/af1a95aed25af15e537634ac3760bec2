The Herald Nyore Madzianike Senior Court Reporter Investigations into the alleged assault by MDC-Alliance member Netsai Marova of a police officer at Harare Central Police Station are almost complete, with the docket now in the hands of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). The NPA is checking if enough evidence has been gathered to proceed with the trial. Prosecutor Mr Lancelot Mutsokoti on Monday told the court that the district public prosecutor was perusing the docket to ascertain whether or not all the relevant evidence was available to start trial. Mr Mutsokoti said the State would furnish Marova with a trial date when she returns to court on April 25. Marova is charged with assaulting a police officer or alternatively of disorderly conduct. The allegations are that on March 5 at around 7.40pm, police officers from the Law and Order section wanted authority to detain Joanna Mamombe and Cecillia Chimbiri on allegations of participating in an illegal public gathering. Marova is alleged to have blocked a police officer, Linnet Mtero, from taking the two to holding cells and caused commotion in the process. The court heard that Marova then punched Mtero four times on the chest, resulting in her arrest. Mr Dennis Mangosi presided over the case.
