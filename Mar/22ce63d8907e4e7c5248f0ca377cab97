The Herald TURIN. — You would think the man who had just dumped European giants Juventus out of the Champions League would be swarmed by the press. But Porto boss Sergio Conceicao’s was forced to leave his post-match press conference after just 50 seconds, with no journalists asking any questions on the live stream on Zoom following his side’s famous Champions League win in Turin. Porto upset the odds to move into the quarter-finals on away goals after a 3-2 loss on the night, with the tie ending 4-4 on aggregate after Sergio Oliveira’s crucial free kick in extra time. Led by Cristiano Ronaldo, Juventus’ dream of lifting Europe’s grand prize went up in smoke again, as Oliveira opened the scoring from the spot before Federico Chiesa netted a double after the break to take the tie to extra time. Oliveira’s second seemingly put the game to bed before Rabiot’s scored to make for a tense finale. — Mailonline.
