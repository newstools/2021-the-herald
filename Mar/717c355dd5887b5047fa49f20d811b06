The Herald Tadious Manyepo in FRANCISTOWN, Botswana THE Warriors are expected to go for PCR Covid-19 tests at the hotel they are staying ahead of the 2021 Afcon penultimate round qualifier against Botswana. This is despite the fact that they also did the same tests in Harare on Tuesday night to which everyone came out negative. The results of the PCR tests are valid for 48 hours. When the team played Algeria away last November, they used the certificates they had from Harare. But, Botswana authorities have insisted that everyone should be tested again. When the team arrived in Francistown last night, they also underwent a rapid Covid-19 test and each of them returned a negative result.
