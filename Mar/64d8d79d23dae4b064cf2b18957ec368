The Herald Crime Reporter Police have arrested two men and recovered six firearms at Gonarezhou National Park. The guns were believed to have been in the process of being smuggled to Mozambique and have since been taken to the Ballistics Division for further investigations while the two suspects are still assisting police with investigations.

Police then recovered the rifles which included, a Remington 700 rifle, Gal.375, two HH Mag. 375, a W/N Mag. 458 and one Cormki Max. Investigations have so far indicated that the suspects wanted to smuggle the firearms to Mozambique through Sango Border Post. The guns had obliterated serial numbers. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the developments. “Police in Mwenezi have arrested two men and recovered six firearms on March 15, 2021.
