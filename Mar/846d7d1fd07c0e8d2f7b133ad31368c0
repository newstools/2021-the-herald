LAND developer, Felix Munyaradzi, who is facing allegations of attempting to defeat the course of justice and interfering with a State witness, Assistant Commissioner Erasmus Makodza, today told the court that the top police officer trumped up accusations against him in a bid to block him from demanding an outstanding debt he owes him. Munyaradzi is accused of attempting to lure Assistant Commissioner Makodza, who is a State witness in another case before the courts, to withdraw charges laid against him involving stands. Yesterday Munyaradzi claimed in court that he extended a credit facility to Asst Comm Makodza when he wanted to apply for a loan at a bank to save a piece of land that was to be seized by the Ministry of Local Government. He said Asst Comm Makodza begged him not to publicise issues surrounding the unpaid debt as he was likely to tarnish his name since he was eyeing the Commissioner General of Police post. Munyaradzi denied ever sending people to ‘sweet-talk’ Asst Comm Makodza to withdraw the charges against him. He made the claims when he took to the witness stand while making an application challenging his placement on remand on obstructing the course of justice charges. The application was heard before Harare Provincial Magistrate Mrs Vongai Guwuriro. The State led by Miss Audrey Chogumaira had applied for his placement on remand saying there was reasonable suspicion that he committed the offence. Mrs Guwuriro is expected to make a ruling a tomorrow.
