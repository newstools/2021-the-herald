The Herald LONDON. — Manchester United captain Harry Maguire struggled to contain his frustrations on Wednesday night as he and Marcus Rashford became involved in an X-rated bust-up. The Red Devils looked lacklustre and found no way to break down Roy Hodgson’s side as they left south London 14 points behind Engfish Premier League football leaders Manchester City. With Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side running out of ideas in the second half, tempers flared with Maguire and  Rashford involved in a flashpoint. The United skipper expressed his frustration as Rashford was flagged offside whilst attempting to get on the end of a header into the Palace half. And it reportedly led to the England striker responding by appearing to call his skipper a “f***ing k***head”. The Red Devils were held to a goalless draw by Crystal Palace — a third straight stalemate – to effectively end their title hopes. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men now trail leaders and neighbours Man City by 14 points. And that led to tempers flaring between the skipper and forward. The angry on-pitch verbals came when Maguire showed his frustration as Rashford was flagged offside. The forward asked: “What do you want me to do?” An irate Maguire then replied: “F*****g get back onside!” However, Rashford was having none of that and he let rip at the experienced former Leicester City centre-half. According to the Daily Mirror, he yelled: “Shut the f*** up, f***ing k***head.” The pressure of a hectic run of games appears to be finally showing throughout the United squad. They have now gone almost five hours – 285 minutes — without a goal. And former right-back Gary Neville said on Sky Sports: “It’s a really poor performance, let’s be clear about it. They’re so bad. “The touch from Marcus Rashford in the second half has been awful. He can’t control the ball when it comes to him at the moment.” — The Sun.
