The Herald Senior Arts Reporter kwaito musician Sikhululekile Mpofu, affectionately known as Sku in the showbizz industry, has bounced back on the music scene, saying marriage had kept her busy for the past five years. The “Hamba Nobani” hitmaker, who took the industry by storm back then together with her brother Mbekezeli “Po Zee” Mpofu, recently released a single titled “Dakona”, which she featured producer Deejay Holly. The single is already on rotation on national radio stations and has received rave reviews. In an interview, Sku said she has been concentrating on business and marriage,  in her residence town of Victoria Falls, but she has since divorced. “I have been silent due to many things and needed to take rest. I got married and needed time with my husband and I was also helping my dad on his business in Victoria Falls, so it was hectic. “I am now divorced and will be remaking my old songs to fit with the current trends.” Sku’s last production was in 2016 when she recorded a gospel track called “Sbusiso Sami”. She said her new song was a dedication to God for fighting in her corner through trials and tribulations she faced in her life. “This was a dedication to the man above for being ever faithful to His word.” Sku said during her musical hiatus, she was doing some behind the scenes projects. “I have always been in the game but behind the scenes. As you know, I work alongside my brother Po Zee, so I was grooming and mentoring two upcoming artistes from our label Kas-no-valo.” Sku said she has embraced technology and how it has changed the complexion of the industry. “The game has definitely changed in a big way. This time it’s now easier to market your stuff because of the technology, uploading your music online and interacting directly with fans. We no longer rely mainly on local television and radio stations, our fan base is much broader now.” Sku is in Harare where she is marketing her single and will be making a video this month.
