Examination classes went smoothly back to school yesterday with teachers and pupils following the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines. The three examination classes, Grade 7, Form 4 and Form 6, opened yesterday after President Mnangagwa and the health authorities cleared the schools reopening soon after the relaxation of the lockdown level. The rest of the classes go back on Monday next week. In Harare yesterday morning schools visited by The Herald had opened their education doors, and pupils were being checked for temperature and sanitising hands at the gate before admission. Everyone was wearing a facemask and no one was crowding. At class entry points, there were buckets to wash hands before entering into classrooms. Teachers were also in attendance and were wearing facemasks and observing social distancing. Visits were made to both Government and private schools to sample how the reopening was working: Dzivarasekwa 1 High School, Warren Park High School, Maranatha High School, Herentals College and Cannonbury Junior School.
