The Herald China’s Sinopharm vaccine against COVID-19 won widespread praise from Hungarian netizens after Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban received an injection of the vaccine on Sunday. Netizens swarmed online after the posts of Orban being administered the vaccine, with many thanking the government for adopting China’s vaccines, which has made Hungary a leading country in Europe in terms of receiving vaccines. “Vaccinated!” Orban wrote on Facebook, posting a photo of himself getting the shot, a close-up of the Chinese vaccine and a picture of a door to the vaccination point where he received the inoculation. Orban received the shot two days after Hungarian President Janos Ader, who also opted for the Chinese vaccine. Gimesi Ferencne, a netizen from Hungary, wrote that she and her husband both received the vaccines and felt good, adding that this was the message that she wanted to deliver to those who doubt or are boycotting vaccines. Another netizen, Zsuzsanna Solyom, posted that she was thrilled to see so many people getting vaccinated and thanked the fast and effective methods adopted by the Hungarian Prime Minister. With access to vaccines from five producers, namely China’s Sinopharm, Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Russia’s Sputnik V, Hungary, the first European Union member state to buy and authorize the use of Chinese vaccines, began administering the Sinopharm vaccine on Wednesday.-Global Times
