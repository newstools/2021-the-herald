The Herald Zvishavane-based platinum miner and Implats subsidiary, Mimosa Mining Company, has handed over state-of-the-art training and research equipment worth US$130 000 to the Midlands State University Faculty of Engineering and Geo-sciences. The donation is in line with the company’s “Invest Beyond Mining” drive, comprising wi-fi enabled microscopes, one of which has an in-built camera, a wi-fi router and a 7th generation iPad. The equipment is the latest microscope technology and only the MSU and one other university in South Africa have that state-of-the-art equipment in the region. Speaking during the hand-over ceremony at the MSU Zvishavane Campus last week, Mimosa general manager, Engineer Stephen Ndiyamba said the donation was motivated by the company’s guiding philosophy to nurture partnerships and“invest beyond mining”. <img class="size-full wp-image-537648" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/ENGINEER-STEPHEN-NDIYAMBA.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/ENGINEER-STEPHEN-NDIYAMBA.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/ENGINEER-STEPHEN-NDIYAMBA-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Eng Ndiyamba “We realise the value of education and we have made this sector one of the critical areas of our intervention in the quest to improve academic excellence in the nation,” said Engineer Ndiyamba. The new philosophy has seen the mining concern supporting MSU and other academic institutions in the country through infrastructure development, provision of equipment, learning aids and scholarships. “We believe that in making such investments, Mimosa will be investing in Zimbabwe’s future. It is this quest to provide the equipment needed for students to excel that has motivated us as Mimosa to partner with the Midlands State University in the provision of training and research equipment in the form of microscopes. Speaking while receiving the equipment, MSU pro vice-chancellor for Research and Academic Affairs Professor Alois Chiromo said it would assist in capacitating the institution to improve quality of education. “Your contribution is a most welcome development, that will see the  Midlands State University realise its goals. As Mimosa Mining Company  you have made a huge investment in your human resources. The students that we are teaching here, will become your human resources. So, by  investing in us, you will be investing in your future human resources,” he said. Mimosa Mining Company has a long relationship with the Midlands State  University which has seen many of its employees enrolling for various capacity building programmes at the institution of higher learning. — New Ziana
