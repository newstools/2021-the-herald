A fugitive Hurungwe man has been arrested for waylaying and killing a 15-year-old girl before disappearing with groceries she had been sent to buy at Doro Business Centre. Tawanda Kasinga (26) of Nyamupfukudza Village 2 under Chief Dendera in Hurungwe allegedly ambushed the girl on February 7. The family got worried after she did not return, prompting searches which led to the discovery of girl’s body in a bush near Doro Business Centre. Investigations led to Kasinga’s arrest on Monday and recovery of some grocery items, including some body lotions which he had given to his relatives. It has emerged that Kasinga has been on the police wanted list for robbery and theft in Magunje. Police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the incident and thanked the public for providing vital information leading to Kasinga’s arrest.
