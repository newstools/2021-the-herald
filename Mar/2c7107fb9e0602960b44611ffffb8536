More than 40 families in the arid Madyangove communal lands in Chivi North have started reaping benefits from a horticulture garden set up in their area to boost household incomes and engender food security. The horticulture garden is irrigated from a solar-powered borehole, benefiting drought-stricken families in Gudhe and Svondo villages in Ward 6. Besides maize, vegetables and cow-peas production, plot holders at the scheme now want to expand into garlic and sugar beans production. Gudhe-Svondo Horticulture garden chair Mr Clemence Mushuku says the garden, established last year, has already started accruing benefits in terms of income and food security. Ward 6 Councillor Godfrey Mukungunugwa, who is also the Chivi Rural District Council chair financed the horticultural garden project for the villagers.
