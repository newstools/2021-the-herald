The Herald MANCHESTER. — Runaway leaders Manchester City went 14 points clear at the top of the English Premiership table last night with an impressive 5-2 thrashing of a battling Southampton at the Etihad. Two goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez and another for Ilkay Gundogan gave City all the three points. A gutsy performance from Southampton, who were briefly level through James Ward-Prowse’s penalty, was not enough to stop the hosts from another victory. Che Adams pulled another goal back in the second half but City were too clinical with Mahrez turning on the style. The match was the 13th different Premier League game to see seven, or more goals, this season and only in the 1992-93, 1997-98 and 2009-10 (all 14) seasons had more games, with seven or more goals, been seen, in the competition. City were desperate to put their defeat by city rivals Manchester United behind them. Pep Guardiola’s side 21-game unbeaten run came to an end on Sunday. Gündogan has now scored 10 league goals in 2021, one of four players in Europe’s top five leagues to reach double figures this year, after Robert Lewandowski (14), Lionel Messi (12) and André Silva (10). — Mailonline.
