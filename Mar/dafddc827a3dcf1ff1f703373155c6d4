The Herald Minneapolis. — The family of George Floyd reached a $27 million settlement with the City of Minneapolis last Friday. Floyd, a Minneapolis man, died in police custody after being arrested in May last year. A video, which went viral, shows police officer Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he said, “I can’t breathe.” His death reawakened the Black Lives Matter movement, which has long been at the forefront of exposing police brutality exerted towards black men in America. The Floyd family attorney Ben Crump said it was the largest pretrial settlement ever for a civil rights claim, and has thanked the city leaders. “It’s going to be a long journey to justice. This is just one step on the journey to justice,” Crump said. “This makes a statement that George Floyd deserved better than what we witnessed on May 25, 2020, that George Floyd’s life mattered, and that by extension, Black lives matter.” George Floyd’s brother Philonise also reacted and said: “If I could get him back, I would give all this back.” The settlement comes as Chauvin faces trial for charges of second-degree unintentional murder and second-degree manslaughter for Floyd’s death. — Aljazeera.
