The Herald Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sport Reporter ZIMBABWE international Khama Billiat says the last three months have been difficult for him because of the injury that sidelined him from competitive football for both club and country. The Kaizer Chiefs attacking midfielder returned to training this week. He has been out of action after sustaining an injury during a South African Premiership tie against Maritzburg United on January 9 at FNB Stadium. He told the club’s website that he was tormented by the injury. “It has been difficult,” reflected Billiat on his time out of action. “We are professional footballers and we always want to contribute by playing through hard and good times so you can grow as a person. “I got injured against Maritzburg United and I never saw it coming. I have never been in a situation where I have had to miss so many games. “It was difficult for me. I thought I would push myself harder and come back as soon as possible but I understand that everything happens for a reason. I thank God for the strength, and I feel better at the moment.” The Zimbabwean international started training this week and is pleased with the progress he is making with his recovery. He said he is focused on getting back on the field of play and help Chiefs finish their DStv Premiership campaign strongly and progress in the Champions League. The creative heart of Chiefs’ midfield has provided five assists and scored one goal in 16 games in all competitions this season until Maritzburg’s players laid siege to him and he had to leave the field with a leg injury back in January. The 30-year-old player is hopeful that he could get some game time on Saturday when Chiefs host Wydad Casablanca in a crucial CAF Champions League game.
