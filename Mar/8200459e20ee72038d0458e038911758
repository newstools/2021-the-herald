The Herald Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter GIANTS Dynamos and Highlanders are set to get domestic football back in action after more than a year of inactivity when they clash in the 2021 Independence Day Trophy. The football rivals have been invited to provide part of the entertainment for this year’s Uhuru celebrations. The match, however, is likely to be played behind closed doors under the Covid-19 prevention and containment protocols. The announcement was made by Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Monica Mutsvangwa at the eighth post-cabinet media briefing this week. “Two most popular clubs, Dynamos and Highlanders, will compete for honours in the President’s Independence Day Trophy under strict WHO protocols and national guidelines to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 virus,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. Highlanders are the holders of the trophy which was last played in 2019 when they beat eternal rivals Dynamos 2-0 at the National Sports Stadium. The tournament was not played last year after the domestic Premiership failed to kickoff in 2020 following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.  Football was grounded the whole year as it was classified within the medium to high-risk category. But recently Government, through the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation gave the green light for resumption, in line with the provisions of Statutory Instrument 81of 2021, as read with Statutory Instrument 200 of 2020. The game is set to recommence in a gradual process, starting with the Premier Soccer League and the Women’s Soccer League.
