The Herald London. – Buckingham Palace says it may consider appointing someone to spearhead its efforts around diversity. The news comes weeks after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Meghan, told Oprah Winfrey that a member of the royal family raised the issue of how dark their unborn child’s would be. “Diversity is an issue which has been taken very seriously across the Royal Households. We have the policies, the procedures and programmes in place but we haven’t seen the progress we would like in terms of representation and more needs to be done, we can always improve,” said a royal source. “The work to do this has been underway for some time now and comes with the full support of the family,” the source added. Regarding reports circulating in multiple UK media that the royal family may appoint a “diversity chief,” the source said it was “something that has to be considered,” but it was “too early” to announce any “firm plans.” “Lots of measures are being considered. Certainly the idea of someone to spearhead this work and look at diversity / inclusion across the three households is something that has to be considered. It is too early however for any firm plans to be announced. We are listening and learning, to get this right,” said the source added. – Yahoonews.
