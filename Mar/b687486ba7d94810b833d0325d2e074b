The Herald CHANNEL 4 news presenter Jon Snow has welcomed a baby boy with his wife Dr Precious Lunga. The TV journalist, 73, announced he and his academic wife, 46, had a baby boy via surrogate on March 2 after suffering “numerous medical setbacks and miscarriages”. “In our desire to seal our now 11 years of marriage with a baby, my wife suffered numerous medical setbacks and miscarriages,” Jon said in a statement. “Consequently, we will always be deeply grateful to our surrogate, who carried our embryo to term. “Amid these challenging times, we feel doubly blessed to be able to celebrate our good fortune.” Jon also has two older daughters from his first marriage to former partner Madeleine Colvin, 64. He married Zimbabwean academic Precious, who is 27 years his junior, in 2010. But he doesn’t see age as a barrier to love and previously said: “She’s somewhere in her forties. “She’s very, very mature. I mean, she’s a serious boffin.” Jon is a veteran news broadcaster who has worked as the main anchorman on Channel 4 News since 1989 and previously worked various journalism jobs for ITN.-TheSun
