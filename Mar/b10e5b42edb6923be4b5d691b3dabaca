The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter IN-FORM golfer, Robson Chinhoi, continued with his fine form, after yesterday’s opening round of the Kenya Open. Chinhoi and compatriot, Scott Vincent, are two of the few African players who are featuring in the European Tour co-sanctioned tournament, on the Safari Tour. The tournament will open Kenya’s first European Tour double-header with the Savannah Classic set for March 23 to 26, at the Karen Country Club. Chinhoi, who teed off in the morning, finished the opening round on four-under par. He was tied in 11th place, as there were several ties, on position one and two. Vincent was on two-under and the former Chapman player is good at turning on the show, in the later rounds. The Kenya Open has a prize money of £1 million pound. Chinhoi has been based in the East African country for close to a year. Vincent is not new to European Tour tournaments and is likely to make the cut, after today’s decisive second round. Four local professional golfers also teed off, during yesterday’s opening round of the Gauteng championship, presented by Betway, at Ebotse links. Ben Follet-Smith, Mark Williams, Greg Bentley and Shaahid Mahmed are part of the field fighting in the R1 million-purse tournament. Follet-Smith will go into today’s round as the best placed Zimbabwean, after he carded a one-under par. Williams was two strokes adrift, on one-over par, while Bentley and Mahmed have low prospects after carding six-over par.
