Court Reporter MDC-Alliance activist Netsai Marowa, charged with assaulting a police officer at Harare Central Police Station last week, was yesterday freed on $15 000 bail by a Harare magistrate. Harare magistrate Mr Sheunesu Matova asked her to report once a fortnight to the police after she allegedly assaulted a police officer at Central Police Station while demanding release of other MDC-Alliance members Joana Mamombe and Cecilia Chimbiri. Marowa is charged with assaulting a peace officer or alternatively disorderly conduct. It is said that on March 5 at around 7.40pm police details from Law and Order wanted authority to detain Mamombe and Chimbiri on allegations of participating in a public gathering. Marowa is alleged to have blocked a police officer Linnet Mtero from taking the two to holding cells causing commotion in the process. The court heard that Marowa then punched Mtero four times on the chest resulting in her arrest. Harare Provincial magistrate Mrs Vongai Guwuriro is also today expected to make a ruling on Mamombe and Chimbiri on charges of violating the Covid-19 national lockdown measures. Allegations facing the duo are that on February 25 this year, they joined some protestors, who have since been arrested and appeared in court.
