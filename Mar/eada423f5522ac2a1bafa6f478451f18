The Herald MADRID. — Atletico Madrid took many people by surprise, earlier this season, with a more expansive attack-minded brand of football. A far cry from Diego Simeone’s usual 4-4-2 formation, Atleti switched to a 3-5-2, with flair players like Yannick Carrasco, Thomas Lemar and Joao Felix, trusted in key areas. It was a resounding success, leading Los Rojiblancos to the Liga summit. At the start of February, they had a 10-point lead at the top, which has since been reduced to six. However, with the league reaching the business end, and the title now in sight, it appears Simeone might be reverting to type if their recent displays are anything to go by. While the rearguard action could not keep Real Madrid out in last weekend’s 1-1 home derby draw, they shut up shop after coming from behind to take the lead against Athletic Bilbao in Wednesday’s crucial 2-1 victory at the Wanda Metropolitano.
