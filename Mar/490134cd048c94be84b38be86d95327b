The Herald Elita Chikwati Agriculture Reporter Harnessing water resources for social and economic development is a necessary condition for Zimbabwe to attain Vision 2030, Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Resettlement Minister Dr Anxious Masuka said yesterday to mark World Water Day. Government has already committed $10 billion towards the construction of dams in the country while $700 million has been set aside for the rehabilitation of water treatment plants at 14 centres across the country. More than 20 irrigation schemes will be rehabilitated. Provisions of the Water Act and the Zinwa Act are also being reviewed in response to the merging social and economic challenges in the water sector. World Water Day this year is marked under the theme “Valuing Water”. Minister Masuka said the theme came at a time when Government was seized with implementing programmes and projects to boost access to water and providing affordable water security for development. “Without water there is therefore no life, and there cannot be any socio economic development. In line with the National Development Strategy 1 and the Agriculture Food Systems Transformation Strategy, Government aims to provide portable water for all by 2025, through the drilling of 35 000 boreholes in the 35 000 villages across the country and ensuring that the 9 600 schools each has a borehole,” he said. Unicef chief, Water and Sanitation Hygiene (WASH), Ms Cindy Kushner said children required water and it was important that water be made available to them to ensure they should have access to clean water for food and nutrition security.
