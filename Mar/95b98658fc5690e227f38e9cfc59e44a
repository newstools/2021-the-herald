The Herald Blessings Chidakwa Municipal Reporter Sunningdale 1 residents in Harare have petitioned Parliament to stop the illegal construction occurring in the area which they say has led to the drying up of the sole borehole in the suburb. The Sunningdale Residents Association represented by Mr Quincy Peterson, Mr Colin Nyangani and Ms Eustace Beru said construction works are ongoing despite reservations they had with the Harare City Council. “We are worried by the destruction of wetlands for agriculture purposes and the construction of brick and mortar structures in such areas, which permanently destroy ecosystems which generate drinking water. “Concerned in particular at the construction occurring on wetlands opposite St Martins Convent School, along Seke Road, which resulted in a natural stream being diverted to make way for the construction and which we believe has resulted in the drying up of the only borehole servicing Sunningdale 1 residents,” said the residents.
