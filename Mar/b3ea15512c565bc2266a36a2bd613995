The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter WANTAGE defied the odds to win the 1 600 metres Ipi Tombe Stakes at Borrowdale Park on Sunday afternoon. Wantage, from the Bridget Stidolph yard, was outstanding as he, and Teaque Gould, helped their stable win three of the seven races, including the future race. The four-year-old took on his elders at level weights and made it look easy as he romped to victory.  By Ato, and bred by Newbury Racing and Breeding, and owned by Newbury Racing, Wantage showed promise as a three-year-old and he has now won six races. The two most fancied runners, Yarraman and Peggson, fluffed the start. Yarraman broke out of the stalls, and had to be brought back from the 1 400m mark and reloaded — on his way to finishing fourth. Peggson was very slow, and was left with far too much to do, although he tried hard to catch up with the field. Mr Greenlight ran second, and Three To Tango was third, as Yarraman completed the places.  Earlier in the afternoon, Ultra Edge scored in the 1450m Maiden Plate, followed by Fortuna Doro in the MR 75 Handicap, also over 1450m.  Wantage is owned by Gael and Denis Evans of Newbury Racing (Pty) Ltd. There were late scratchings, mainly due to a virus sweeping through some of the yards, and it proved a scare, in the 1200m Maiden Plate, where the field was reduced to three Borrowdale Park first-timers – Green Serenity, Peacable and Master Of My Fate filly, Hedwig. Hedwig, trained by Gokhan Terzi, won the race by a staggering eight lengths, with Hennie Greyling aboard. Gengiz Goksel, Mike Eaton, Gary Carter and Paula Lewis own Mazikeen -also trained by Terzi and ridden by Greyling – who was another runaway winner in the 1600m Novice Plate.  This time the winning margin was four lengths and placings went to Seattle Swift, Magic Mike and Farm Yard Tractor. Mazikeen, is a three-year-old filly, by Twice Over (GB), bred by Klawervlei Stud
