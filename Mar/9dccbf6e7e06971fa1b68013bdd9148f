The Herald Sports Reporter THE chances of the France-based pair of Tino Kadewere and Marshall Munetsi, featuring for the Warriors in the 2021 AFCON qualifier against Botswana in Francistown, on Thursday, have faded today. This is despite all the spin, which has been coming from the ZIFA camp, that the duo could be secured to play for their country against the Zebras. The association have been sending signals that they expect the duo, to get on a private plane, which was bringing in Mozambican France-based centreback, Mexer. The 32-year-old defender, whose real name is Edson Andre Sitoe, plays for French Ligue 1 side, Girondins de Bordeaux. However, The Herald can reveal Mexer has already landed in Kigali, where his team are preparing for an AFCON qualifier against Rwanda, tomorrow. The Mozambican side arrived in Kigali last night. How ZIFA officials had planned to get the plane, organised by Mozambique, which took Mexer to Kigali, to then fly to Harare, with Kadewere and Munetsi, is still a mystery. There has always been doubts, pertaining the availability of the two players, for the crunch battles, since French authorities introduced tough regulations, to try and combat the spread of Covid-19. However, a ray of hope emerged at the weekend, after clubs in France agreed to release players, provided they would travel to their respective countries, using private flights, to enable them to be exempted from mandatory 11-day quarantine for returning residents. ZIFA spokesperson, Xolisani Gwesela, said all hope was still not lost, for the duo to feature for the Warriors. The association, it appears, are considering trying to bring the duo, for the final qualifier against Zambia, at the National Sports Stadium on Monday night.
