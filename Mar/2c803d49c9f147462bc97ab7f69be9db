ZIMBABWE’S Chevrons have powered their way to a rare away Test cricket victory with a 10-wicket demolition of Afghanistan, inside just two days, at the Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi today. It’s an historic achievement, for the Chevrons, as it marks the first time they have won a Test match, inside two days. Captain Sean Williams led the way with the bat, in his team’s response to Afghanistan’s first innings score of 131, with his fine century helping Zimbabwe to 250. Regis Chakabva (44), provided him with a useful ally, as they added a match-winning 75-run partnership, for the seventh wicket to take a big first innings lead. Afghanistan, once again, struggled, in their second innings, slipping to 21-5, and then 47-6, before being bolwed out for 135. Blessing Muzarabani (2-14) and Victor Nyauchi (3-30) did the early damage, upfront, while Donald Tiripano destroyed the tail with 3-23 from his 9.3 overs. His victims included opener, Ibrahim Zadran, who was the only one to offer resistance, with his 76, accounting for 58 percent of his team’s second innings total. Needing just 17 runs, to win the match, the Zimbabwean openers, Prince Masvaure and Kevin Kasuza required just 3.2 overs, to complete the crushing victory.
