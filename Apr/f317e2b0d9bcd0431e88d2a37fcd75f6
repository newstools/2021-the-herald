The Herald Ricky Zililo in BULAWAYO ZIMBABWE international defender, Peter Muduhwa, says he is a frustrated man after his contract was terminated by Tanzanian giants, Simba SC, without playing a game for them. Muduhwa joined the club, who have qualified for the Champions League quarter-finals, just after the CHAN finals in Cameroon, in January. However, his contract was cancelled, without him playing even a match for them. “For more details, you can talk to the agent (Gibson Mahachi), but it’s true, I’m coming back home,’’ said Muduhwa, who was a pillar of strength, in the Highlanders defence. “You know, as a player, it’s frustrating to do everything in training and fail to make it into the match day squad. “I know the coaches have the final decision, but I guess it’s better to look for fresh challenges. “There are a few things that are being tied up before I return, but I’m grateful for the opportunity that I had while here at Simba.’’ The deal was initially for six months. Since his arrival at Simba, the club have played five CAF Champions League group matches, booking a place in the quarter-finals of the tournament, and top group A with 13 points. They are five points clear of defending African champions Al Ahly, who are second, and also through to the next round. The Zimbabwean defender only managed to make the travelling squad, when they went for the group opening match against AS Vita of DR Congo. “It’s unfortunate that such a talented player like Muduhwa is coming back to Zimbabwe,’’ sources said. “The Simba leadership met a few days back and decided to release the player because some were asking what value he is adding to the club. “No one could fight for Muduhwa when his matter was being discussed.’’ George Deda was the agent that initiated Muduhwa’s move to Simba SC although the player belongs to the stable under the leadership of Gibson Mahachi.
