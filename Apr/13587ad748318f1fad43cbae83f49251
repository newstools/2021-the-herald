The Herald Prosper Dembedza -Court Correspondent HARARE magistrate Mrs Loice Mukunyadze has issued a warrant of arrest against land developer Georgios Katsimberis, accused of duping Pokugara Properties (Pvt) Limited of close to US$1 million in a joint venture to build cluster houses in Harareâ€™s Borrowdale suburb. The warrant of arrest was issued after Katsimberis failed to come to court. Accusations levelled against Katsimberis arose from a joint venture agreement he entered with Pokugara Properties in 2016, to construct six houses in Borrowdale through his company, GK Properties. One of the material terms of the agreement was that six residential stands, each measuring 2 000 square metres, were to be consolidated for building 21 cluster houses. It is said Katsimberis promised to build the houses within weeks but took two years to build one small 166 square-metre show house, using sub-standard materials such as the use of metal frames which are not approved in Zimbabwe. The show house was not approved and did not follow due process to be circulated to the correct departments in the City of Harare while the stamps on the plan were allegedly fake. This led to only one show house partly being finished before it was declared an illegal structure by the City of Harare and a demolition order was issued.
