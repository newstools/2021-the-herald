Award-winning Afro RnB songstress and actress Tamy Moyo has said that despite the Covid-19 pandemic, she wishes to work hard to produce more hits and singles. The “Ndibereke” hit-maker made the revelations this morning as she announced that she will be dropping her new single titled, “Phone Call’ah” which she said was a dedication to her brand and God. The song is premiering on Star FM, around 11am. “The song ‘Phone Call’Ah’ talks of how I hope and dream to work more in order to achieve more. With my management we are so grateful for the creative forces behind the brand who have allowed us to come this far; above all our maker, the giver of all gifts – God!. Once again we are humbled by your support,” she said. Tamy said the new single was a follow up to her successful chart-topping song “Kuteera” featuring Jah Prayzah. “It is a small celebration for the recent Star FM Awards and I really appreciate your support. The song is a follow up from Kuteera. I will work on the visuals though,” she added.
