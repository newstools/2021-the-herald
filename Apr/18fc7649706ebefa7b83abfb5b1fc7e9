The Herald Zvamaida Murwira-Senior Reporter THE Sadc Parliamentary Forum has hailed the security organ of the regional bloc for taking decisive action against the bandits that are causing terror in Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado province. The parliamentary regional bloc Standing Committee on Democratisation, Governance and Human Rights adopted a resolution commending the decision of the Sadc Troika comprising Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa on Tuesday during an ongoing virtual meeting. Sadc PF vice chairperson Mr Darren Bergman from South Africa moved the motion reiterating the importance of peace and security in the region. “We welcome the decision by the SADC Double Troika to immediately deploy back-up to the Mozambique army. (We) reiterate the importance of preserving life and for swift action to subdue the insurgents and ensure return to normalcy for the ordinary people and for commerce and trade,” said Mr Bergman. The Committee, chaired by Mr Jerónima Agostinho from Mozambique, held the virtual meeting. “I wish to call on Parliaments in the SADC region to shake off the ‘rubber stamping’ label and rise up to the occasion by vigorously guarding the ‘separation of powers’ and ‘checks and balances’ and ensuring that the relationship between the three arms of State is one of equality and independence. “Parliaments should be mindful of the fact that any encroachment on the powers of one arm by another has an adverse effect on Constitutionalism and the rule of law,” said Mr Agostinho. University of Zimbabwe law lecturer, Professor Lovemore Madhuku who was one of technical experts urged parliaments to pay attention to their relationships with the judiciary, in particular protecting its independence, ensuring meaningful citizen participation in the democratic processes.
