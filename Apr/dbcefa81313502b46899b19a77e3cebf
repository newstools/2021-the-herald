The Herald Conrad Mupesa -Mashonaland West Bureau GOVERNMENT has started procuring and distributing sanitary ware to primary and secondary school girls. Primary and Secondary Education Deputy Minister Edgar Moyo said all the provincial education offices across the country have now started receiving the sanitary ware. Although he could not give the amount availed and the number of sanitary pads procured so far, he said the idea to avail children with free pads was one of the ministry’s running programmes. “I’m sure shortly our schools are going to be receiving the sanitary pads. This is some of the things that the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education is doing to demonstrate sensitivity to the plight of the girl child. “We do not want our girls to be affected by not coming to school because of a natural menstrual cycle,” he said. Mashonaland West education director Mr Gabriel Mhumha confirmed receiving the sanitary ware and said distribution to schools will commence soon.
