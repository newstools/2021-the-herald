The Herald Cletus Mushanawani in Nyanga GOVERNMENT has called on all ministries and development partners to mainstream disability in planning, designing, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of all programmes and projects. Speaking during a disability mainstreaming workshop in Nyanga this morning, Deputy Chief Secretary in the Office of The President and Cabinet, Dr Martin Rushwaya, said as part of disability mainstreaming, the National Disability Policy has been formulated to address the marginalisation and discrimination of persons with disabilities. “It also empowers them to improve their quality of life as well as enable them to contribute towards the national development agenda. It also sets standards for the inclusion of persons with disabilities in all facets of life, thereby serving as an overarching policy framework on disability across all sectors,” said Dr Rushwaya. Zimbabwe is one of the few African countries with legislation that specifically caters for persons with disabilities. Dr Rushwaya reiterated calls for all Government departments and development partners to move away from theoretical rhetoric to practical and tangible realities on the ground for the empowerment of persons living with disabilities.
