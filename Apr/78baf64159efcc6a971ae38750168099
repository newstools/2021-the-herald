The Herald Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter FORMER Zimbabwe cricket team captain and coach Heath Streak has apologised to the cricket community for letting the game down. Speaking for the first time since he was handed an eight-year ban by the International Cricket Council earlier this month after accepting five charges of breaching the ICC anti-corruption code, Streak said he takes full responsibility for his actions. The 47-year-old’s transgressions are centred on disclosing inside information, and facilitating corrupt approaches, for betting purposes. “It is with a heavy heart and anguish that I come before all of you mindful and aware that I have let a lot of people down through my actions and omissions,” he said in a statement. “Whatever my intentions were, I understand that when one agrees to be bound by a set of rules there can be no excuse for not following them and as I engaged the ICC, over the past two years, during this very difficult process, I realised the marked difference between fault and responsibility. “I apologise sincerely to my family, friends, the cricket loving public and most of all my fellow Zimbabweans who have, over the years, shown me love and support during the numerous trials and tribulations we have faced.” Streak was found guilty of accepting cash and gifts, in exchange for his information, when he was fully aware this was not allowed by the ICC. He also tried to conceal the evidence. Streak admitted to accepting two bitcoins, from the bookmaker, which was subsequently converted into US$35 000 cash. He was also gifted with a new iPhone. However, Streak did not disclose the approaches, which is an offence, and the gifts to the ICC Anti-Corruption Unit or the Designated Anti-Corruption officials. He also tried to delay investigations, and also defeat the course of justice, by deleting WhatsApp messages, and exchanging notes with his co-accused Indian partner, during the investigations by the Anti-Corruption Unit.
