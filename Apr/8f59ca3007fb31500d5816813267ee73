The Herald PALMA, Mozambique. – Twelve expatriates were found beheaded as they attempted to flee an Islamic State-claimed attack on the northern Mozambique town of Palma, near natural gas projects worth $60bn (R870bn), a local police commander told state TV station TVM. The bodies of the contractors, who had been tied up and beheaded, were found under a tree outside the hotel in Palma, witnesses say. The hotel has been subjected to multiple lootings since the attack and almost every room has been ransacked. Palma, which was overrun by fighters a fortnight ago, has been reclaimed by the Mozambique army. Zvika Karadi, a contractor who was returning to check on his construction yard, said he was blown away by the destruction. The police commander Pedro da Silva told journalists visiting the town that he could not be sure of the nationalities of the expats, but he believed they were foreigners because they were white. – Africanews.
