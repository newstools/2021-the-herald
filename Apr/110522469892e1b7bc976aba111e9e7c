The Herald Jim Steinman, the colourful composer behind hits like Bat Out Of Hell and Total Eclipse Of The Heart, has died at the age of 73. His brother Bill told the Associated Press that the songwriter and producer had died of kidney failure on Monday after being ill for some time. “I miss him a great deal already,” he added. Singer Meat Loaf, with whom Steinman scored his biggest hits, said goodbye with the words: “Fly Jimmy Fly”. Bonnie Tyler also paid tribute, saying she was “absolutely devastated” by news of her friend’s death. Outside of music, “he was also a funny, kind, supportive, and deeply caring human being,” the Welsh singer wrote. “The world is a better place for his life and his work and a worse one for his passing.” Known for his bombastic, operatic productions, Steinman hit the big time in 1977 with the Meat Loaf album Bat Out Of Hell. Styled as a rock opera, it contained hits like You Took The Words Right Out Of My Mouth and Two.-BBC
