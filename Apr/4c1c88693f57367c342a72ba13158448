The Herald Prosper Dembedza–Court Correspondent Suspected armed robber Steven Sigauke, arrested while in alleged possession of unregistered firearms and ammunition, had his bail revoked after failing to come to court on April 1. Sigauke is jointly charged with Stewart Kazenga and Mike Katsande. Sigauke told the coutrt that he failed to attend the court session as he was undergoing treatment at a traditional healer after falling seriously ill. But Magistrate Mr Dennis Mangosi revoked Sigauke’s bail, ruling the default was wilful, saying he did not produce any documentation proving he was unwell, nor that he was at a traditional healer. It is alleged that on October 19 last year, Sigauke, Kazenga and Katsande were intercepted by police and army manning a roadblock along Bulawayo Road driving a Honda Airwave without registration number plates, intending to rob a miner. They were allegedly found in possession of a 12 bore Baikal shortgun, with two rounds, and a Norinco pistol with magazine loaded with one round. CID Homicide investigated and found that none of the three were registered owners of any firearm or ammunition.
