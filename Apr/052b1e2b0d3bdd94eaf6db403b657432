The Herald Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE international cricketer PJ Moor will be heading to Ireland where he is scheduled to play club cricket this season. The 30-year old wicketkeeper-batsman has agreed to join the Munster Reds inter-provincial squad for the 2021 season. Cricket Ireland chairman of national selectors, Andrew White, said Moor’s experience will be crucial in the young Muster squad. “It goes without saying that PJ Moor’s quality and his broad experience – and time spent previously in Ireland – will be a valuable addition to the Inter-Provincial Series for this season. PJ has performed at the highest levels of the game, and he will offer a great deal to the young Munster squad. “This also allows Pebbles [Neil Rock] to return to the Knights and fill the gap left by Gary Wilson’s retirement. “This development adds further interest to what is shaping up to be an intriguing inter-provincial series, which will only raise the standards of the competition and should additionally provide some tough, competitive cricket for our elite players ahead of the internationals,” said White. Harare-born Moor holds an Irish passport and has previously played club cricket in Ireland for YMCA and CIYMS. He has represented Zimbabwe in eight Tests, 49 ODIs and 21 T20Is, and was part of the Zimbabwean men’s squad that played a six-match white ball series against Ireland in 2019. He was among the six regular players that missed Zimbabwe’s recent series against Afghanistan due to a hamstring injury. But he has since returned and featured for Tuskers in the recent Logan Cup tournament.
