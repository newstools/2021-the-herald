The executive had association’s president Aaron Jani and his two vice-presidents Losson Mtongwiza and Martin Shone. Jani questioned the delay by the province to kick-start the regional league after the association received the nod from the Government for sporting activities to resume. Jani was visiting the province where he met with the provincial board members, as part of a national tour to assess the progress by regional leagues to resume competitive games and to map the way forward on the resumption of the sport in the country. The Government in March lifted the suspension of sport as part of the relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions that were imposed to minimize the spread of the virus. As part of the conditions for the resumption of matches, all players and officials should be tested for Covid-19 before every game and spectators would not be allowed at the match venues. The Union president said other provinces in the country were now fully geared to start competitive games within their respective leagues but Midlands had not made any preparations. “Why haven’t you started playing rugby when you have the players, the teams and the facilities? In other Provinces their leagues are already prepared to start,” Jani told the Midlands Province executive at the weekend. The mini-league has four teams that include two Midlands State University teams from their Gweru and Zvishavane campuses, Airforce of Zimbabwe and Gweru select, which draws players from communities in Gweru.
