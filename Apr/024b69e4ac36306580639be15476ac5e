Upcoming Harare-based Afro-Jazz artiste has released a nine-track debut album in which he bemoans the increasing loss of family moral values in contemporary society. Born, Sam Mungate, the musician who trades by the stage name, Mkoma Sam said his new album, “Family Matter” is an attempt to interrogate the essence of moral values in families at a time when the future of children is being endangered by domestic issues which are swept under the carpet on the pretext of being a family issue. Speaking ahead of the album’s official launch which is slated this week, the artiste’s manager Mr Willard Chirunga said the artwork is an attempt to conscientise families on the importance of moral uprightness. “Mkoma Sam is a strong subscriber of Afro Jazz genre, inspired by the late music icon Oliver Mutukudzi, he hails from Mashonaland Central province, therefore, his conceptualisation of traditional and cultural tenets of Shona people heavily influenced this album. “Family Matter as the title track connects all songs such as “Mwanasikana”, “Garinge”, “Sandirombe” and “Nguva”. “ In today’s families, you will notice that wrong ways are being used to solve problems. Family courts are at times used to conceal criminal offenses such as rape cases, child marriages as family members hide certain immoral issues under the pretext of family matters. “ Therefore the title track is a social commentary song that alludes to the need for proper handling of issues using proper channels other than using the umbrella term “Family Matter”, said Chirunga. ‘Hazvidi Tsiva’ is also a track that speaks about gender-based violence and sensitive issues around women and cultural beliefs, raising awareness on respecting mothers, pregnant women and the girl child. Mkoma Sam is also a holder of a Bachelor of Accounting Degree from the University of Zimbabwe, currently reading towards LLB with MSU and has taken music to comment on societal issues.
