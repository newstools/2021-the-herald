The Herald Ellina Mhlanga -Senior Sports Reporter OVER 90 swimmers are on Sunday set to converge at Chisipite Senior School for the Harare Amateur Swimming Junior Championships with some of the province’s leading juniors expected to compete. The competition will this year be held over one day due to the prevailing environment because of the Covid-19 pandemic unlike in the past when it was held over two days. Five clubs – Highlands, Spartans, Pirates, Otters and Dorados of Country Districts – are expected to take part in the championships. Participants will take part in the nine and-Under, 10, 11 and 12-year-olds age groups. HAS public relations officer Shingirai Mtetwa confirmed the event will take place on Sunday with over 90 swimmers registered to take part. “We have both boys and girls swimming. Ninety-four swimmers have registered for the championships. This event is a straight finals event whereas in the past we had preliminaries and then finals. So in the past we would hold the gala over two days but this year it will be done over one day only,” said Mtetwa. The gala will be held under strict ovid-19 regulations with no spectators and less officials to minimise the numbers. The provincial board is also looking at wrapping up their season’s programme with a short course gala early May. “We are hoping to hold a short course gala at the beginning of May. This will be done in a heated pool and will be our last gala of the season,” said Mtetwa. HAS recently took part in the South Africa Junior Championships with a team of nine swimmers and picked up nine medals. And as they turn to their local competitions they will be hoping for another exciting meet as they get lose to the end of the season.
