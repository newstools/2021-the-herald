The Herald COLUMBUS. – A 16-year-old black girl was fatally shot by an officer outside her home after she called the police for help on Tuesday afternoon, according to her family. The girl has been identified as Ma’Khia Bryant by her aunt, Hazel Bryant. Bryant allegedly called officers at about 4:30 p. local time when a group of “older kids” threatened her with assault, her aunt said. The Columbus Police Department could not say on Tuesday whether Bryant was the one to call for assistance before she was shot. Bryant was taken to a local hospital in critical condition, where she later died. Interim Chief of Police Michael Woods told reporters the officer will be pulled off patrol duty as the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation looks into the shooting. – NPR.
