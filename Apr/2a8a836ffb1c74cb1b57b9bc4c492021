The trial of land developer Georgios Katsimberis accused of duping Pokugara Properties (Pvt) Limited of close to US$1 million in a joint venture to build cluster houses in Harareâ€™s Borrowdale suburb failed to kick off following indications that the presiding magistrate Mrs Loice Mukunyadze was not available. Katsemberis was recently issued with a warrant of arrest after he failed to attend court. His lawyer Mr Tendai Biti told the court that they had made an application for the matter to be referred to the Constitutional Court. Mr Biti tendered a copy of his application to magistrate Mrs Sandra Mupindu for the matter to be referred to the Constitutional Court.
