The Herald Zvamaida Murwira -Senior Reporter Prisoners who have previously been released on amnesty will not benefit from the current Presidential clemency order published in a Government Gazette this week. The clemency order also excludes those prisoners who have a record of escaping from lawful custody and those that have been sentenced by a Court Martial. This is contained in a Statutory Instrument of an Extraordinary Government Gazette published on Tuesday by Secretary for Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, Mrs Virginia Mabhiza. The bulk of those set to benefit include female prisoners and juveniles who would have served at least a third of their sentences provided that they were not convicted of specified offences. Specified offences include murder, treason, rape or any sexual Offences, trafficking in persons, public violence, unlawful possession of firearm and car jacking among others. Some of those on the list to benefit include terminally ill, those above 50 years with underlying conditions and those in open prisons.
