The Herald Prosper Dembedza Court Correspondent Harare Magistrate Mr Dennis Mangosi has deferred to May 5 the matter of suspected land baron Felix Munyaradzi who is facing charges of attempting to defeat the course of justice and interfering with a State witness. Munyaradzi is accused of attempting to coerce Police Assistant Commissioner Erasmus Makodza, who is a State witness in another case before the courts, to withdraw charges laid against him. The court heard that sometime in July, the complainant, Asst Comm Makodza, filed a report of fraud against Munyaradzi after he sold him a residential stand that was later sold to another buyer.  It was the Stateâ€™s case that Munyaradzi was arrested and taken to court before being released on bail by the High Court and as part of his bail conditions he was ordered not to interfere with witnesses. On an unknown date in January this year, the court heard, Munyaradzi allegedly sent emissaries to try and influence Asst Comm Makodza to withdraw the charges and negotiate an out-of-court settlement before the case ran its course.  Munyaradzi allegedly threatened Asst Comm Makodza with arrest if he failed to comply.  The court heard that Munyaradzi unlawfully defeated or obstructed the course of justice by interfering with a State witness who was due to testify against him in court.
