The Herald BEIJING. – Chinese President Xi Jinping yesterday urged Germany and the European Union (EU) to make joint efforts with China to protect and promote the healthy and stable development of their cooperation so as to bring more certainty and stability to the volatile world. President Xi made the remarks in a phone conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, China-Germany ties grow steadily and show strong resilience and potential, President Xi said, noting that China has remained Germany’s largest trading partner globally for five consecutive years. We hope the two sides could push forward cooperation in various areas in the spirit of mutual respect and benefit, which will bring more vitality to the China-EU cooperation and increase confidence in world economy revival, he added. The year 2022 marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Germany, and the two sides should seize the opportunity to boost exchanges in technology, education, culture and sports. When dealing with the challenges, it’s of importance that China and the EU keep the relations on the right track, respect each other’s interests and exclude external influence, President Xi said, stressing that China is willing to work with the EU in high-level exchanges and deepen and explore pragmatic cooperation in various areas as well as climate change and global governance. – CGTN.
