The Herald Alec Masocha Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE Prisons and Correctional Service’s sports teams have taken the lead in getting vaccinated against Covid-19. The players and officials received their first jabs of the Sinovac and Sinopharm yesterday. Women Super League perennial campaigners, Correctional Queens FC, Rainbow Netball League champions and Lower Division sides, Nehanda Queens and Prisons FC, all had their players and officials vaccinated. The Covid-19 pandemic brought all domestic sporting activities, to a halt, in March, last year. However, the Government have since cleared top-flight football leagues to resume and there is a lot of activity, among the teams, in preparation for the new season. Prisons sports teams’ spokesperson, Allan Marimira, confirmed the developments. “The whole technical staff, and players, were vaccinated, it was important for the players to get vaccinated to prevent the spread of the pandemic.’’ The vaccination process has been taken as part of the preparations of the 2021 women soccer season, later this month. Prisons Health Compliance Officer, Zvikomborero Kativhu, in conjunction with the Ministry of Health and Childcare and the Ministry of Sports, Arts and Recreation were instrumental in initiating the vaccination process. Correctional Queens head coach, Choice Nyama, said he was happy with the vaccination programme and promised tests will  be done after every 14 days. He also promised his team will continue to follow the Covid-19 protocols as prescribed by the Sports and Recreation Commission.
