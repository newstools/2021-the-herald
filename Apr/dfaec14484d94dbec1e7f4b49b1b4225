The Herald Daniel Chigunwe Mashonaland Central Correspondent A man was this week allegedly murdered at Jumbo Mine in Mazowe by an artisanal miner during a scuffle over gold proceeds. Allegations are that the deceased, Richard Makoto, had sponsored a group of artisanal miners to mine the gold and in return would share with them the proceeds after selling the ore. Reports say a heated argument arose between Makoto and the artisanal miners before one of them grabbed a shovel and hit him on the head, killing him instantly. Mashonaland Central police spokesperson Inspector Milton Mundembe could not confirm the incident as he referred questions to national police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi. Asst Comm Nyathi said he was not yet aware of the incident. Reliable sources said Makoto was murdered on Tuesday around 2am at a gold mill in Amatola, within the Jumbo Mine area.
