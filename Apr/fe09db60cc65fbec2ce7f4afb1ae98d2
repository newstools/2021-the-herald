The Herald LONDON. — English football clubs will stage a three-day social media boycott next weekend as part of a protest against racism, several national governing bodies announced on Saturday. The blackout, encompassing England’s governing Football Association, clubs in the Premier League, English Football League and Women’s Super League, will begin at 1400 GMT on Friday, April 30 and run until 2259 GMT on Monday, May 3. Referees and managers’ organisations will also be involved. A joint statement from the participating organisations said they would unite for a social media boycott “in response to the ongoing and sustained discriminatory abuse received online by players and many others connected to football”. It added: “This has been scheduled to take place across a full fixture programme in the men’s and women’s professional game and will see clubs across the Premier League, EFL, WSL and Women’s Championship switch off their Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts. “As a collective, the game recognises the considerable reach and value of social media to our sport. The connectivity and access to supporters who are at the heart of football remains vital. “However, the boycott shows English football coming together to emphasise that social media companies must do more to eradicate online hate, while highlighting the importance of educating people in the ongoing fight against discrimination.” Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson recently said he would be prepared to follow Arsenal and France great Thierry Henry in abandoning all online activity as a protest against racist behaviour. Swansea acted after Yan Dhanda, Ben Cabango and Jamal Lowe were all targeted, while England’s Marcus Rashford, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Raheem Sterling are also among a long list of players to have been subjected to racist abuse.  — AFP.
