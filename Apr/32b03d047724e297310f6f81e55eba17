The Herald Thupeyo Muleya -Beitbridge Bureau Government, through the Judiciary Service Commission is working on a Standard Operating Procedure (SPO) protocol on the management of sexual and gender-based violence, the Deputy Minister of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Ruth Maboyi has said. She said the SPO will help to ensure that policies are implemented and followed through. The Deputy Minister told stakeholders in Beitbridge recently at an event organised by the Women Action Group (WAG) and the Ministry of Women Affairs and Community Development, that the level of gender-based violence in the country was alarming. She said a sharp increase in GBV cases against women and girls including child marriages and teenage pregnancies were recorded nationwide in the first and second Covd19 related lockdowns. “Reports indicate that over 1000 girls are getting into child marriages and almost 5000 cases of teenage pregnancies are reported in a space of three months,” said Deputy Minister Maboyi. “These alarming statistics present clear evidence of the need to take action to end violence against women and girls. We cannot achieve an equal future if the life of the girl child continues to be affected by child marriages and teenage pregnancies”. She said there was a worrying trend in which most of the girls or victims of GBV pull out of schools whilst the boy continues with his education. She also urged the Government to re-align laws and policies to the constitution and also ensure that existing policies and laws are implemented.
