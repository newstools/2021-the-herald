The Herald A MAGNIFICENT century by Regis Chakabva took Eagles into a position of dominance over Tuskers on the second day of the Logan Cup at Old Hararians yesterday. Overnight, he had scored 51, in a first-innings total of 165-5, with his partner Faraz Akram on 34. Yesterday, the pair took their sixth-wicket partnership to 167 before Akram was finally caught and bowled by Ainsley Ndlovu for a fine supporting innings of 65. Brad Evans, in next, scored 22 in a rousing partnership of 57 with Chakabva, but the tail did not last very long. Chakabva was the last man out for 164, scored off 186 balls with 17 fours and two sixes, the 16th century of his first-class career. The Eagles total was 344, a lead of 230 runs over their opponents. Tuskers went in to bat again at a serious disadvantage, which was quickly made far worse as Richard Ngarava shattered their top order. He dismissed Brian Chari lbw for 10, and then had Tanunurwa Makoni, caught behind by Chakabva for nine, before bowling out Craig Ervine for seven. With PJ Moor out lbw to Evans for two, and Milton Shumba caught off Akram for one, the Tuskers innings was in tatters at 30 for five wickets. Luke Jongwe, and their new wicket-keeper, Clive Madande, saved them from complete humiliation with a fighting stand of 57 for the sixth wicket before Madande was out for 25. Meanwhile, some fine pace bowling by Travor Mutsamba of Southern Rocks set back Mountaineers in their Logan Cup match at Harare Sports Club yesterday. In the morning, Mountaineers resumed their first innings at 272-9, with Andre Odendaal on five and last man, Mutsamba, having just come in. Mutsamba looked fairly comfortable, so Odendaal took a couple of overs getting his eye in, and then began to open up, pulling short balls from Donald Tiripano for four and six. He looked to do the same to Victor Nyauchi, but, looking to run a quick leg-bye at an lbw appeal, he was run out for 19, by a direct hit on the stumps, from Timycen Maruma. Rocks were all out for 292, with Mutsamba not out on four. Vincent Masekesa was the most successful bowler with 3-71, while there were two each for Nyauchi and Wellington Masakadza. Mountaineers opened their innings with Joylord Gumbie and Gary Chirimuuta. But, without a run on the board, Chirimuuta played a loose stroke to a ball from Odendaal, outside his off stump, and was caught by the wicket-keeper, Tafadzwa Tsiga. Then, Gumbie slashed at a ball from Mutsamba and was caught in the slips by Richmond Mutumbami, and Mountaineers had lost both openers, without a run on the board. Worse was to come, as Dion Myers was also given out, caught behind in Odendaal’s next over – three wickets down with no runs inside four overs. Runs finally appeared on the board when Maruma drove a ball from Mutsamba through extra cover for four. Just as the situation seemed to be normalising, Maruma was forced to retire hurt, as a shoulder injury prevented him from using his bat properly – he had scored 18 out of 26, on the board. Shingi Masakadza joined Tony Munyonga, and runs began to come more freely, as the bowlers tired. Shingi took every opportunity to attack the bowling, scoring 20 off 26 balls by lunch, reaching his fifty off 63 balls but, without adding another run, he was bowled by a good ball from Mutsamba. Two overs later he produced another that shattered the stumps of Donald Tiripano (1), and two balls later trapped Clive Chitumba lbw without scoring; the score was now 96 for six, and Mountaineers were in trouble again. Munyonga (58) and Wellington Masakadza (54) helped repair come of the damage.
