The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE’S 4x100m relay team member Ngoni Makusha believes they can build on their previous experience when they get onto the track at the World Relays scheduled for Saturday and Sunday in Poland. The meet is going to take place at Silesian Stadium in Chorzow. The other members of the team are Dickson Kamungeremu, Itayi Vambe, Makanaka Charamba and Rodwell Ndlovu. They arrived in Poland on Thursday. Makusha, Vambe, Kamungeremu, and Tatenda Tsumba made up the team that qualified and competed at the 2019 World Relays in Yokohama, Japan. However, Tsumba could not make it for this edition. After a disappointing show in 2019, the athletes are hoping for an improvement this time around. Makusha said they now know the demands that comes with competing at this level and are going to push for a better outcome. “The expectation is obviously is to make it to the final, which we didn’t manage to do last time. So we are going to push for that. “Yes we have lots of experience in the team, and we know how to handle the pressure and I believe we can achieve our goal,” said Makusha. The top eight teams from this competition automatically qualify for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. It is also serving as a qualifier for next year’s World Athletics Championships to be staged in the United States. “We are really taking this seriously. It’s a huge opportunity for us as a team, so it’s on us to go out there and perform,” said Makusha. The team is accompanied by coach Lisimati Phakamile.
