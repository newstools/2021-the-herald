Zimbabwe staged a historic fightback with the ball to record their first-ever win against Pakistan in T20I cricket at the Harare Sports Club today. Luke Jongwe, who returned to the national team fold after a five-year hiatus, was the key man in the 19-run victory as Zimbabwe bowled out their much-fancied opponents for a meagre 99 runs. The feat finally brought to a screeching halt a losing streak that had stretched to 15 games. The game looked like it would follow the usual script after Pakistan won the toss and put Zimbabwe to bat first on what appeared to be a difficult batting track. The Chevrons stumbled to 118/9. Tinashe Kamunhukamwe was the top scorer for Zimbabwe with 34 runs, although he needed 40 balls to achieve that.
Most of the Zimbabwean batsmen failed to rise to the challenge with Regis Chakabvaâ€™s 18 runs, the second highest score for the home team.
Mohammad Hasnain and Danish Aziz took two wickets apiece. Pakistan innings were supposed to be a routine dash to the finishing line considering the low target.
But the Chevrons scored another first as they managed to defend the lowest winning total at Harare Sports Club.
Brendan Taylor was named stand-in captain after Sean Williams was rested because of a hand injury and he commanded the field with aplomb.
Unlike the first game, Zimbabwe did not drop catches, neither did they give away too many extras, as Pakistan were strangled to their lowest batting total against the Chevrons in T20I.
Jongwe was named Man of the Match after taking four wickets, including two in the final over when Pakistan needed 20 runs from the last six balls.
He was also involved in the run out of Usman Qadir in the first ball of the decisive over as Pakistan scampered for the required runs.
The series is now balanced on 1-1 after Zimbabwe lost the opening match by 11 runs on Wednesday. The final match is on this Sunday.
