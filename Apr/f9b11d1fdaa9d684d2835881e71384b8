The Herald Grace Chingoma -Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE’S neighbour South Africa are still in the race to host the inaugural CAF women’s Champions League finals towards the end of the year amid revelations from CAF that they have not awarded hosting rights to any country. Recently Morocco federation announced through its website that the country has been named the host of the first-ever women’s club tournament. But CAF at the weekend clarified the position and is likely to name the host soon after closing the bidding process last week. This development means Zimbabwean representatives Black Rhinos Queens and other southern region clubs, who are poised to participate in the qualifiers run under the COSAFA banner, will have an advantage of an extra slot to the finals scheduled for November. Two clubs from the southern region will have a chance to go to the finals, with a South African club getting an automatic ticket to the finals
Seven clubs from different regions qualify for the finals after staging competitions along the zonal lines. The army side Black Rhinos Queens have since been entered by ZIFA to participate in the competition after winning the 2019 league. The local women’s league is set to start on June 19. Clubs are expected to start training next week after conducting Covid-19 tests.
