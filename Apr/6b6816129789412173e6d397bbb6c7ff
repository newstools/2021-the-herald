The Herald Blessings Chidakwa Municipal Reporter Mutoko Rural District Council has suspended its acting chief executive Samson Zulu who is appearing in court facing several allegations of corruption. The decision to suspend Zulu was made during a full council meeting held last Friday, a few days after his arrest by the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc). He is currently out on $10 000 bail. Mutoko RDC chairperson Councillor Christopher Karimazondo confirmed Zulu’s suspension. Zulu stands accused of allegedly flouting procurement procedures by offering work to do road maintenance to a group of young people in Mutoko’s Ward 20 without advertising or considering at least three different bids as provided for in the laws of the country. He also allegedly facilitated the release of $140 000 to the youths without assessment of the work by an engineer. The council’s engineer is on suspension but the meeting resolved that they could have sought the services of the District Development Fund engineers to approve the work done. In February, Zulu is said to have corruptly sold a business stand without following due procedure. He allegedly instructed the beneficiary to deposit into Mutoko RDC CBZ Nostro account number 24148840110 a down payment of US$50 000 for the stand.
