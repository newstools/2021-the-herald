The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Senior Sports Reporter THE national Under-21 men’s handball team is scheduled to resume its periodic camps this week in Chitungwiza after more than a year of inactivity. The Under-21 side is part of the Vision 2024 programme by the Zimbabwe Handball Federation to build a formidable side that can challenge some of the best teams on the continent and compete for a place at the Olympics. The team led by coach Innocent Kanosvova and Farai Mukundu is set to have a four-day camp from Wednesday to Saturday. ZHF secretary general, Edson Chirowodza, said they are looking forward to the resumption of their activities after a long break. “The camp is part of our long term national team development strategy. “It is very important to resume activities as our players had a very long break. We were fearing that some will gain weight and lose their fitness. However due to continuous engagement online by the coaches we are hopeful they are still in shape. “Resuming will give us an opportunity to assess their level of fitness as fitness tests will be conducted on the first day of the camp,” said Chirowodza. The national federation is also considering taking part in an invitational tournament in Cape Town, South Africa, from May 21 to 25. It would be a boost for the side that has not had any competitive match for more than a year.
