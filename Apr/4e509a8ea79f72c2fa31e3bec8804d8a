The Herald Precious Manomano Herald Reporter The Zimbabwe Liberation War Collaborators Association (ZILIWACO) has urged citizens to participate in the national Covid-19 vaccination programme. In an interview, chairperson of the organisation Cde Ben Mubayisango said vaccination against Covid-19 was a commitment made by President Mnangagwa to end the pandemic in the country. He said people should consider the vaccine seriously because it was critical in arresting the spread of the pandemic and the President had been leading the fight against Covid-19 from the front. “We lead by example in everything we do,” said Cde Mubayisango. “President Mnangagwa was vaccinated and we should all follow our leader and there is nothing to fear because it was scientifically proven that it is harmless so we should take the jab. “These vaccines help minimise the risk of infection and are being administered to all people, so get vaccinated now to stop the spread of the disease.” Cde Mubayisango said people should ignore misconceptions and lies peddled on various social media platforms about the vaccines. “Do not listen to falsehoods circulating on media platforms, lets all participate in the vaccination programme,” he said. Zimbabwe is among the first African countries to vaccinate citizens against Covid-19, a development that saw the Government getting a pat on the back from the World Health Organisation (WHO) for its handling of the pandemic. Vaccination uptake is increasing in all parts of the country.
