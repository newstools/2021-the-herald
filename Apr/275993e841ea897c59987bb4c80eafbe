The Herald Prosper Dembedza-Court Correspondent The trials for suspended Harare City Council town clerk Hosiah Chisango, suspended director of housing and community services Addmore Nhekairo and town planner Samuel Nyabezi on criminal abuse of office charges, start on May 26. The date was set yesterday by Harare magistrate Mrs Loice Mukunyadze. The three are all remanded out of custody on $50 000 bail each. Allegations are that sometime in 2019, the trio illegally effected a change of use plan for land in Kuwadzana 3 without seeking Government approval as required under the Urban Councils Act. The State alleges that Chisango then handed over 13 provisional allocation letters to Getrude Dumba, the managing director of Bluffhope Investments, a consultancy company they had hired to facilitate the procurement, development and survey of stands on their behalf. The State further alleges that Chisango later instructed Dumba to deposit $130 000 into City of Harareâ€™s bank account for the intrinsic value of the land and then later another $100 000 into a corporate bank account belonging to a company called GlenRoy. Nhekairo also allegedly instructed Dumba to deposit $100 000 into a CBZ bank account registered in the name of Kennedy Teerechire and the money was deposited into both accounts on December 5, 2019. It is further alleged that Chisango and his accomplices misrepresented to Dumba that council had approved the conversion of the land for residential purposes. Chisango is being represented by lawyer Mr Ray Goba.
