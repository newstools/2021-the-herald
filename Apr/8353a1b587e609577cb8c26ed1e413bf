The Herald LONDON. — Chelsea will step up plans to re-sign Romelu Lukaku in a £90 million-plus deal. Inter Milan’s star is seen as the most achievable of boss Thomas Tuchel’s targets. Lukaku is on a list that includes Borussia Dortmund’s Erling Haaland, but the young Norwegian star looks out of reach with Manchester City in pursuit. So, the Blues are turning to a player with proven English Premier League experience, firstly with them seven years ago, followed by spells at West Brom, on loan, Everton and Manchester United. Chelsea believe they need a strong centre-forward to lead the team next season. And frustration with current striker Timo Werner is also growing after Tuesday’s 1-1 Champions League semi-final first-leg draw at Real Madrid. The German, 25, missed a golden chance to score, just like he did at West Ham three days earlier. And the £48m forward is failing to convince Tuchel he is the man to spearhead Chelsea’s attack for the next few years. At 27, Lukaku is at his peak. He has scored 27 goals for Inter this term and is considered mentally strong enough to handle leading the line for a club like Chelsea next season. Tammy Abraham (23) failed to persuade Tuchel he is what Chelsea needs, despite being top scorer with 12 goals this season. He is being linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge this summer with West Ham favourites to sign him. Meanwhile, Arsenal are ready to pursue a bargain £17.5million deal to land Borussia Dortmund ace Julian Brandt, according to reports. The Gunners are in the market for a creative midfielder this summer with Martin Odegaard heading back to Real Madrid. Boss Mikel Arteta has been told by Zinedine Zidane that they will not entertain any offers of extending Odegaard’s stay in North London. The Norwegian is seen as fundamental to Zidane’s plans and wants him to compete in midfield alongside Toni Kroos and Luka Modric. — The Sun.
