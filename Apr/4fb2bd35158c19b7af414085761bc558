OLYMPIC Lyon star Tino Kadewere, through his Kadewere Foundation, has donated full sets of home and away kits to his former club, Harare City. The red-hot forward joined the municipal team as a teenager seven years ago before he secured a move to Swedish side Djurgadens. He has been enjoying his game in the French Ligue 1 after joining from second division side Le Havre last year. And he hasn’t turned his back on the team which shaped his career, Harare City. The Kadewere Foundation, through its chairman Prosper Kadewere delivered the kit to City this afternoon. Speaking at the handover ceremony, Prosper said “This is only the beginning. Harare City helped Tino to be who he is today. “We are very much appreciative of the role this team played in the grooming of Tino. “So, this donation is only the beginning. Our relationship with Harare City is deep and we can only say we will be there for the team. Even Tino is always thankful for the role Harare City played in shaping his career. “It is only prudent for him, through the Kadewere Foundation that we come in, making donations like these.”
