The Herald LOS ANGELES.– Known for their perfectly glazed sugary treats, people now have another reason to appreciate doughnut chain Krispy Kreme. Starting Monday, anyone who shows a valid Covid-19 vaccination card at a Krispy Kreme store in the United States will receive a free glazed doughnut. “I came straight to Krispy Kreme after I heard the news,” said Tae Kim, 32, who wasted no time in claiming his free doughnut in the Los Angeles suburb of Burbank after being vaccinated. The free treats will be available to every vaccinated person every day until 2022, so no one will be left out, even those not yet eligible for a vaccination, said Dave Skena, Krispy’s chief marketing officer. Not everyone praised the giveaway, with some Twitter users pointing to the link between obesity and the severity of Covid-19 infections.  Krispy Kreme gave away over 30 million doughnuts in 2020. It has no idea how many doughnuts it will give away in the remainder of 2021, Skena said, but the more, the better. – Reuters.
