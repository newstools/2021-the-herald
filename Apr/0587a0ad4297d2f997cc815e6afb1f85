The Herald NEW YORK. – One of two police officers accused of pepper-spraying and pointing their guns at a black US army officer during a traffic stop has been fired, a Virginia town announced late on Sunday, hours after the governor called for an independent investigation. Saying it took the action because it “prides itself in its small-town charm and the community wide respect of its police department”, the town of Windsor said it joined calls from elected officials, including Governor Ralph Northam, in requesting an investigation by Virginia state police. In the December 2020 encounter, two officers are accused of drawing their guns, pointing them at army second Lieutenant Caron Nazario and using a slang term to suggest he was facing execution. Nazario, who is black and Latino, was also pepper-sprayed and knocked to the ground by the officers, Joe Gutierrez and Daniel Crocker, according to the lawsuit he filed earlier this month against them. – The Guardian.
