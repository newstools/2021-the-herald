The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga -Sports Reporter DINDINGWE is expected to continue with his fine form when she lines up for the 2000 meters Zimbabwe 2000, Grade three race – the second leg of the Triple Crown at Borrowdale Park Racecourse on Sunday. The Kirk Swanson stable runner is also on the verge of bagging 2021 Zimbabwe Triple Tiara after she begged the Fillies Classic and the Silver Slipper before.Dindingwe is now left with Zimbabwe Oaks to be assured of bagging the TiaraAt the moment Dindingwe is the only three-year-old in Zimbabwe who could win both the Crown and the Tiarra. In the last event, the Swanson’s stable’s formidable filly won the 1800m by a breathtaking 16 lengths – having previously won the 1600m Fillies Classic, the first leg of the Triple Tiara. For the upcoming race on Sunday, Dindingwe, who won the first leg, the Zimbabwe Guineas on March 21, by finishing a quarter of a length ahead of stablemate True Beauty, will face off with her stablemate once again. True Beauty, who is a force to reckon with, will be lined-up together with Suave Judge, Prescott, True Beauty, Diesel And Dust and Mazikeen.These three-year-old Classics are designed to test both speed and stamina, and stamina will come into play when Sunday’s five runners meet over 2000m. Dindingwe has so far won six of the seven races she has participated in including the Champion Juvenile Stakes, Breeders Fillies Mile, Fillies Classic, Zimbabwe Guineas, Grade Three and the Silver Slipper. The only defeat was by True Beauty in a close finish to the 1200m Jacaranda Free Handicap in October.
