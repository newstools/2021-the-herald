The Herald Eddie Chikamhi -Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE captain Sean Williams will sit out today’s Twenty20 international cricket match against Pakistan at Harare Sports Club as he recuperates from a soft tissue injury to his left hand. The team’s medical unit recommended that he be rested as a precautionary measure aimed at getting him fully fit ahead of the more demanding Test series against the same opponents. In Williams’ absence, Brendan Taylor – who missed the first game due to illness – has been named as Zimbabwe’s stand-in captain for today’s T20I after he was passed fit to play. Tarisai Musakanda has also come in for the injured Craig Ervine in the only other change to the side that played the first game on Wednesday. Zimbabwe lost the first T20I by 11 runs and will be looking to bounce back today. Meanwhile, Pakistan have won the toss and put Zimbabwe to bat first in today’s match. The last game of the series will be played on Sunday at the same venue. The two-match Test series will follow beginning next Wednesday. All the games will be played behind closed doors at Harare Sports Club, with no spectators allowed in the stadium due to Covid-19 protocols.
