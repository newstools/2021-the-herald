The Herald IN a remarkable match, a brilliant innings of 140 not out by Brendan Taylor of Rhinos was capped by an amazing team performance from Eagles at Old Hararians yesterday. Regis Chakabva, Tinashe Kamunhukamwe and Wessly Madhevere all played vital roles that enabled them to seal a stunning victory by six wickets. Eagles won the toss and put Rhinos in to bat, in the day’s first Domestic T20 Competition match. But, the decision seemed to backfire, as in five overs Taylor and Takudzwa Kaitano put 45 runs on the board, without loss. Both attacked the bowling fearlessly, but the bowlers began to pull back some measure of control, so the first 10 overs brought 78 runs, but still without a wicket. Taylor boosted the score by taking a few more risks, reaching his fifty off 33 balls, and the team 100 was reached with another Taylor boundary in the 13th over. This was the first century partnership of the tournament, and it seemed to spur Taylor on to more brilliance, as one boundary after another flowed from his bat, while Kaitano did his bit and did his best to give Taylor most of the bowling. The partnership reached 142 in the 16th over before Kaitano was out for 45, off 38 balls, skying the ball behind the bowler Daniel Jakiel to be caught after a very valuable innings. In the 17th over, after facing 60 balls, Taylor reached his century with a nudge backward of point off Jakiel, his second in T20 cricket. He now went up a further gear, as boundaries flowed faster than ever and the bowlers were reduced to cannon fodder. Taylor, however, seemed to lose his touch in the final over, bowled by Tanaka Chivanga, scoring only seven runs, and failing to take the score past 200, as had looked almost certain. The final total was 194 for one wicket off the 20 overs. Taylor finished unbeaten with 140, scored off 78 balls with 19 fours and five sixes. This is the second highest individual score in Zimbabwe T20 cricket, behind Hamilton Masakadza’s 162 not out for Mountaineers, against Eagles, in 2015/16. Jakiel took the only wicket to fall, one for 39 in his four overs, while the only presentable bowling figures were 21 runs off Brad Evans’ four overs. .
