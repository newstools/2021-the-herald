The Herald Fidelis Munyoro -Court Reporter SERIAL robber David Zungura who was involved in Chitungwiza burglary and made off with over US$3000 last year is not a suitable candidate for bail, the High Court has ruled. Zungura was arrested along with Mbonisi Ndhlovu and Alex Murira last years after they pounced on a Chitungwiza couple and robbed them of US$3250 and other property at gunpoint. The trio was remanded in custody in September last year. However, Ndhlovu and Murira successfully applied bail at the High Court. Zungura’s bid for freedom failed after Justice Tawanda Chitapi last week ruled that the suspect failed to prove that he was suitable for bail. Zungura faces other similar charges, which he did not disclose to the court during the bail hearing nor indicated whether he was on bail for the other offences. It was on this basis that Justice Chitapi could not trust the suspect with bail. He said the grant of bail was largely dependent upon trust which the court reposes on the suspect to appear for trial. There is no explanation as to why the material disclosures of pending cases was not made,” said Justice Chitapi. “Under the circumstances, there are compelling reasons to deny the applicant bail trial. He came nowhere near to discharge the onus to stablish that it is in the interests of justice to admit him to bail.” Charges against Zungura arose July 20, 2020, when the suspect acting in connivance with his accomplices Ndlovu and Murira, stormed the Mateyo couple’s House in Chitungwiza armed with a pistol and a crow bar. While inside the house, the gang allegedly fired a shot in the direction of Mr Mateyo and allegedly struck him with the crow bar while demanding for cash. The couple allegedly surrendered US$3250, which they had at gunpoint. The court also heard that the gang allegedly ransacked the house and stole three cell phone handsets, two Rolex watches, a Samsung 62-inch television set and Mercedes Benz keys before they escaped.
