The Herald Prosper Dembedza Court Correspondent Suspected armed robber Steven Sigauke, who was arrested while in possession of unregistered firearms and ammunition, had his bail revoked after absconding court on April 1. Sigauke is jointly charged with Stewart Kazenga and Mike Katsande. In his defence, Sigauke told said he failed to attend the court session on the day in question as he was undergoing treatment at a traditional healer’s place after falling seriously ill. But Mr Mangosi revoked Sigauke’s bail saying he did not produce any documentation proving he was unwell. “The accused failed to produce any form of document to prove that he was not feeling well, therefore the court is of the view that he was in wilful default,” ruled Mr Mangosi. The court heard that on October 19 last year, Sigauke, Kazenga and Katsande were intercepted by police and officials from the Zimbabwe National Army who were manning a roadblock along Bulawayo Road. It is said the trio was driving a Honda Airwave without registration number plates, intending to rob a miner, and was caught in possession of a 12 bore Baikal shortgun, with two rounds and a Norinco pistol with magazine loaded with one round. Investigations were conducted by CID Homicide and it was discovered that the accused persons were not registered owners of any firearm or ammunition.
