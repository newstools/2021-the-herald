The Herald Herald Reporter The Zimbabwe Media Commission (ZMC) Act, which sailed through Parliament recently, has now assumed legal force and effect after the President assented to it in terms of the Constitution. The Constitution also allowed Parliament to enact legislation to allow the commission to investigate complaints against the media and against journalists, and the new Act does this. Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Permanent Secretary Mr Nick Mangwana confirmed the enactment on Twitter. “We are on track in our efforts to put in place an open and collaborative Media Law and Policy Dispensation. We are very happy that we now have the Zimbabwe Media Commission Act. We have licensed new TVs players, community and campus (radio) stations. We are walking the talk,” he posted.
