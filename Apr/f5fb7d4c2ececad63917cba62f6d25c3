The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — South African football legends, Teko Modise and Jabu Mahlangu, have both spoken of Khama Billiat’s vital role at Kaizer Chiefs. Billiat suffered a knock during Sunday’s 2-1 win over Mamelodi Sundowns in Pretoria and was replaced by Dumisani Zuma just before the half time break. While Zuma went on to grab headlines, by scoring a very well-taken winner, Billiat remains an integral part of the Amakhosi set-up, says Modise. “It’s sad to see a player of his quality come from an injury, and get (another injury), knowing exactly that the team needs him so much,” Modise said in his role as a SuperSport TV analyst. “And, I think, when he is on the pitch, there’s that level of energy within the Kaizer Chiefs team. “Because one, so much attention comes to (Billiat), it frees other players as well. Two, he shares the responsibility with (Samir) Nurkovic and (Leonardo) Castro and Lebogang Manyama. “His understanding with Lebo Manyama as well, he brings a different dimension into the Kaizer Chiefs side and I’m sure Gavin Hunt is very disappointed.” Mahlangu, who went by the surname of Pule during his time as a Chiefs player, thinks injuries have so far curtailed Amakhosi fans from seeing the best of Billiat. “I just feel sorry for him, because he hasn’t reached his full, full potential since coming to Kaizer Chiefs. “And, not that he’s been performing bad, but injuries and knocks (have set back his match fitness and confidence). “We wish him a speedy recovery because these are the kind of players we want to see,” Mahlangu said. In the 84 games he’s played, the former CAPS United and Ajax Cape Town attacker has also contributed 18 assists. — Goal.com
