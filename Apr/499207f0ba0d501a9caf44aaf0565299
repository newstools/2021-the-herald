The Herald Rumbidzayi Zinyuke Senior Reporter China National Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd. (Sinopharm)â€™s Covid-19 vaccine has been issued with a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certificate by Hungarian authorities making it the first Chinese vaccine to receive such certification. According to experts, the certification by the Hungarian National Institute of Pharmacy and Nutrition will significantly enhance competitiveness for Chinese vaccines in the European Union and across the globe. The GMP is a system of ensuring that products are consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards. It is designed to minimise the risks involved in any pharmaceutical production that cannot be eliminated through testing the final product, according to the International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering. Hungary was the first country in the European Union to start mass vaccinations with Sinopharm vaccines in February and so far, no serious adverse reactions have been reported, thereby boosting the confidence in the vaccine. Phase 3 trials done in December last year showed that the Sinopharm vaccine was 86 percent effective and so far, at least 100 million doses have been supplied to more than 80 countries and international organisations across the globe. For most African countries that have limited access to deep-freezing facilities, Sinopharm works better as it can be transported more easily at normal refrigeration temperatures.
