The Herald Alec Masocha-Sports Reporter. THE Zimbabwe Rugby Union are on a nationwide campaign to capacitate officials, and stakeholders, in anticipation of the return of the game. The association took advantage of the Independence holidays and dispatched officials to a number of areas, across the country. The officials conducted Match Officiating Level One and Coaching Course Level One courses in Bulawayo, Hwange and Victoria Falls, from Saturday to Monday. A statement from the association said the courses were being held under the World Rugby Union Training and Education programme. The first course was held at Hartsfield, in Bulawayo, on Saturday, with 16 participants, four of them women. The second was held at the Thomas Coulter School in Hwange where 13 people were in attendance. They concluded the weekend programme at Chambondo School in Victoria Falls with 15 rugby officials in attendance. One of the officials, Simba Dangah, said the training programme was meant to equip rugby officials, in outlying areas, with officiating skills. ZRU are also fighting for inclusivity, by roping in female officials, as shown by the figures attending the courses countrywide. “The Zimbabwe Rugby Union Training and Education Department is doing the courses,’’ the union said in a statement. “The committee is led by Bright Chivandire. He is the trainer. All courses are Level one courses. “Two Educators have done the courses, Ruben Kumpasa — for the coaching course — and Simba Dangah — for the match officiating course. “It’s a ZRU initiative to spread the game to all corners of the country and capacitate all the stakeholders involved in the sport.”
