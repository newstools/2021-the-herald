The Herald On the banks of Hunyani River in Mbire near the border with Mozambique, at Jurujena village near Mushumbi Pools, a boy bakes bread from soya beans flour, without raisings, except salt and sugar. Fire . . . turns embers The result is a hard crusted bake, cracked and slightly burnt up. It is a lump. Under normal circumstances Mbire is a conservative matriarchy when it comes to kitchen chores, but this boy defies odds and his age mates deride and laugh at him. But he is determined to cook and bake more, albeit the stereotyping. In Mbire, a boy child must be virile. He is an epitome of a strong hunter, a masculine boxer and a farmer who never touches pots and plates, let alone cook. Man here are chauvinistic. The Mbire boy, Talent Rijemba, is now a pastry chef at Rainbow Towers in Harare and his story is that of a boy from the village to an all-important chef. While most of his age mates are now redundant, for, there is no longer a place to hunt or fight people, he is employed and enjoying what he knows best-cooking. “I came to Harare in 2009 with nothing, but my cooking talent gained from many experiments in the village,” said Rijemba. “When I got a job here as a porter, I did not know what to wear. “My time came when one of the chefs failed to come to work and there were clients who needed pastry, I seized the opportunity and did it well. The rest is history.’’ Back in his village, Rijemba was infamous among men for competing with girls in cooking instead of competing with other boys in the “hard” stuff. Rijemba attended Nyambudzi Primary School and Mushumbi High School in Mbire. Now he is a classy chef. “During my teenage years, I felt that there is an inner talent, strength and passion to be a chef,” said Rijemba. “I used to prepare nice traditional food at home and my family would task me to bake bread (chimodho) for visitors and even during the festive season. “My parents gave me the moral support and that was my wings to fly and start on.” The Herald Lifestyle on Saturday caught with the most sought after chef at the hotel who shared his journey. “In 2009, I left my rural home to the city of Harare to search for greener pastures,” said Rijemba. “I was employed by the Rainbow Towers Hotel as a kitchen porter on a part-time basis. “The job gave me courage to persevere more after admiring my other peers who were doing the best in the kitchen as I sat by the corner. I started learning professional cooking, especially in pastry kitchen, reading books and watching cooking shows on television.” Rijemba said other pastry chefs were very friendly and keen to teach him how to make other products despite being a guru of “chimodho”. “One night our local baker was absent from work and there was no one to prepare breakfast pastries,” he said. “It was chaotic. I asked to try my best, in fact covering up for my colleague. That was my stepping stone and I wrote in my heart that (the rise of a pastry chef). “The next day all the supervisors were happy and they decided to offer me a job. I got employed as a junior section chef.” Rijemba said his second test was when “I prepared high tea pastries for a Zanu PF Politburo meeting. “My heart beat faster, but I jumped to the challenge. I prepared the best pastries.” Challenge became his habit like a shirt made out of iron. “I began entering into chef’s competitions to learn more and expose my skills,” said Rijemba. “I have won major awards as a chef at Zimbabwe chefs competition in my career. I have a gold medal for Best Ceremonial Cake 2012, a bronze medal for Gateau cakes category in 2017 and two silver medals for Pastry Desserts and Pastries in 2018.” Rijemba said although he specialised in pastry he could make other dishes. “The stove is now like my bed, I know every corner of it and I can do wonders in the kitchen,” he said. “I can also cook other dishes especially Western ones. My favourite meal is stuffed chicken breast with mushroom sauce, saute’ potatoes and mixed vegetables.” Asked who his role model was, Rijemba said he looked up to chef Tonderai Mtswapo. “I am much inspired by chef Tonderai Mtswapo who is one of the finest and iconic pastry chefs in Zimbabwe and Southern Africa,” he said. “He is also my trainer and has won major awards continentally. I like him because of his style and integrity on work.” Rijemba said the stereotype was somehow still there as some were still finding it difficult to accept that a man could cook. He said the best people he needed to impress most was his family. “I am married to Everjoy Mucheche and we are blessed with two children, Taanashe and Tawananyasha,” he said. <img class="size-full wp-image-540984" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/Chef4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/Chef4.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/Chef4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> He is married to Everjoy Mucheche and blessed with two children, Taanashe and Tawananyasha. “We stay in the Dema area and I am also into poultry. “I was stereotyped by the society about choosing this career, but I just ignored the comments and stayed away from those people until they all kept quiet. “It is difficult out there, but we are still defying all odds. I used to be hurt inside about why I was doing this, but I then told myself that it is God who gave me the talent, hence I should not forsake him by denying that I can cook perfectly. “Those that say bad about my chosen career do not deter me. In fact, I always Iaugh at them because the bread and cakes they love eating so much, it is me who makes them, so why should I worry. “The only one challenge which I have is not having adequate time with family. I had to adjust and capitalise on weekend and off days.” Rijemba said in Zimbabwe, chefs’ lives could be changed by appreciating them. “Look at the best renowned international chefs in any expensive restaurant you can name, they are male,” he said. “It is actually true that males are the best cooks. “It is my dream to have a television cooking show and having local chefs taking part in regional cooking competitions. This can be on television to inspire others. We must also have strong chefs’ association which represents us for our challenges and accomplishments.” Rijemba, who is an ardent member of Johane Masowe Apostolic Sect, said given a chance, he would love to cook for a soccer club like Manchester City. “During my spare time, if I am not with my family, I like watching football, doing exercises and playing football,” he said. “This has helped me to stay in shape.”
