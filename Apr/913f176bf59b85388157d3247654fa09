The Herald Crime Reporter Owners of bars, beerhalls and nightclubs who breach lockdown regulations face arrest and will be reported to the Liquor Licensing Board, which may revoke their licences, the police have warned. In a statement yesterday, national police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi urged the public to report bars and the like defying lockdown orders. Bars, beerhalls and night clubs have to remain closed. While bottle stores can sell alcohol, their customers cannot drink on site. “Operators who defied the law during the Easter Holiday in Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru, Mutare and other towns are being dealt with. “Police will ensure that licences confiscated are handed over to the relevant Government arms for the stipulated penalties to be effected. “Police will avail statistics on the operation in due course,” he said. The 231 road accidents recorded over Easter killed 26 people and injured another 148 far more than last year when Zimbabwe was under a level five lockdown when eight people died while 22 were injured in 178 accidents. The major causes of the accidents this year were speeding, inattention,  overtaking errors and failure to observe road rules and regulations. All are forms of human error. “We urge drivers to travel at safe speeds, considering the condition of the roads and safety of other road users. Pedestrians are also being urged to be observant when crossing any road and should check either sides of the road to ensure it is safe to cross before doing so. “Motorists should be patient, considerate and observant on approaching roads under construction or repair,” Asst Comm Nyathi said. He urged the public to continue observing Government’s Covid-19 health, safety and security protocols by wearing face masks, practising social distancing and sanitisation.
