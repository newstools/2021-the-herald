The Herald Prosper Dembedza Court Correspondent Harare magistrate Mr Dennis Mangosi has deferred to May 26 the matter of suspected armed robber Douglas Mutenda,Â  believed to be a member of a gang led by alleged criminal mastermind, Musa Taj Abdul. Mutenda is facing several counts of armed robberies and was last year released on $5 000 bail after the State consented to bail on the basis that some of his co-accused were also out on bail. He was re-arrested on Christmas Eve in Mhondoro after a warrant of arrest was issued against him for absconding. Mutenda will stand trial with co-accused Prince Makodza, Carrington Marasha, Liberty Mupanhanga, Godfrey Mupamhanga, Spicer Takawira and Musafare Mupanhanga. Mutenda is also facing other armed robbery charges with Eddison Mashamhanda, Spicer Takawira, Makodza, Musafare Mupanhanga, Nevanji Madanhire, Christopher Mashamhanda and Dudzai Chidangwara. Mutenda is also expected to appear in court for routine remand on similar charges with Taj Abdul, Musafare and Godfrey Mupanhanga, Spicer Takawira, Marasha, Benjamin Chitunhu and Conwell Kasambarare.
