The Herald BIRMINGHAM. — Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola said the failed European Super League was a “closed chapter” after his side beat Aston Villa 2-1 to move closer to becoming Premier League champions. Guardiola’s side were rocked by John McGinn’s opener for Villa after just 20 seconds. But City recovered impressively as Phil Foden equalised before Rodri put the visitors ahead. “As a club we accept and learn and focus on the reason why we’re here,” said Guardiola, whose side need eight points, from five matches, to become English champions for the third time in four seasons. “It’s a chapter which is over, a closed chapter. They (the owners) don’t need to apologise (to me), I know them, I know how they are.” City’s win leaves them 11 points clear of Manchester United with Guardiola saying his side were “so close” to the title. However, they had a scare when centre-half John Stones was sent off just before the break for a knee-high challenge on Jacob Ramsey. But Villa wasted the man advantage when Matty Cash was dismissed 11 minutes into the second half following two bookings in the space of three minutes. However, Villa were reduced to 10 men as well when Matty Cash earned a second booking for chopping down Foden in the second half. “Not the start I dreamed of but we reacted very well. It was a really good performance,” Guardiola said. “Phil Foden’s influence in our games is massive. He’s becoming a serious player.” City’s bid for an unprecedented quadruple was shattered in Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final defeat against Chelsea. That loss, coming a week after 10-man Leeds won at the Etihad Stadium, raised the possibility of a remarkable late-season collapse from a City side who led the table by 17 points just a few weeks ago. — AFP.
