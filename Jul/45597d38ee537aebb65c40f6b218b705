The Herald LOS ANGELES. — Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 50 points as the Milwaukee Bucks claimed their first NBA title for 50 years with a 105-98 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday night. The Bucks’ 4-2 series win was sealed in front of a 17 000 crowd as 65 000 basketball fans celebrated outside the Fiserv Forum. They are only the fifth team to win the best-of-seven finals series after losing their first two matches. “I’m happy I was able to do it with this team for Milwaukee,” said Antetokounmpo. The Suns were seeking a first NBA crown in their 53-year history, having also lost NBA Finals series in 1976 and 1993. However, they were unable to contain Antetokounmpo, who became only the seventh player to register 50 points in a Finals game. It was also the third game in the series in which the 26-year-old has managed at least 40 points and 10 rebounds. Antetokounmpo matches the feat of Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon by collecting a regular season MVP, NBA Finals MVP and NBA defensive player of the year awards. “I want to thank Milwaukee for believing in me. I want to thank my team-mates for playing hard with me,” Antetokounmpo said. — BBC Sport.
