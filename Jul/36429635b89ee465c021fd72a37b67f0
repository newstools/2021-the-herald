The Herald LONDON. — Red Bull’s Max Verstappen is favourite to beat Lewis Hamilton and win the Formula 1 title on current form, two-time champion Fernando Alonso says. Verstappen leads Hamilton by 18 points ahead of this weekend’s Austrian Grand Prix after four straight wins by Red Bull. The 23-year-old Dutchman is aiming to secure his first drivers’ championship. “Favourite at the moment probably is Max because he is performing better,” said Alpine driver Alonso. “Things can change quickly depending on the performance of the teams and the updates to the car etc.” Hamilton said he felt “positive” about Mercedes’ prospects for this weekend’s race. — BBC Sport
