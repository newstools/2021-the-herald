The Herald LUSAKA. – Zambia’s founding president, Kenneth Kaunda, was yesterday laid to rest at Embassy Park, a special cemetery dedicated for the country’s leaders. Kaunda ruled Zambia from 1964, when the southern African nation won its independence from Britain, until 1991. He died on June 17 at a military hospital in Lusaka. President Edgar Lungu yesterday declared Kaunda’s birthday, April 28, a national holiday in honour of the nation’s first president. Hundreds of mourners attended a church service before the burial, including Mozambique’s ex-president Joachim Chissano, Zambia’s former president Rupiah Banda and Hakainde Hichilema, the head of the main opposition United Party for National Development. His children paid glowing tribute to Kaunda, portraying him as a fighter and teacher whose attributes should be emulated. “Go well, you fought the good fight of faith, you have finished the race. We will miss you so much,” said one of his daughters, Musata Banda. “You wanted three more years to get to a hundred, but you will celebrate your 100th birthday in heaven.” – AFP
