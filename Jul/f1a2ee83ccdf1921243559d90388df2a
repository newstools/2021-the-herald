The Herald Eddie Chikamhi-Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE will go into battle without the experienced duo of Sean Williams and Craig Ervine in the opening match of the One Day International series at Harare Sports Club, today. The duo, who also missed the lone Test, after coming into contact with Covid-19 positive people, was not included in the 16-man squad, announced by Zimbabwe Cricket, yesterday. Brendan Taylor will captain the Chevrons, who have included three uncapped players, in Tadiwanashe Marumani, Dion Myers and Milton Shumba. The match is the first of three games, which are part of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Super League, which forms the qualification pathway, to the 2023 World Cup. The absence of Williams and Ervine was felt during the lone Test that Zimbabwe lost by 220 runs. <img class="size-full wp-image-366676" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/CRAIGERVINE.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/CRAIGERVINE.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/CRAIGERVINE-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Craig Ervine  The situation is likely to put the burden on Taylor again, who led in that match, with two half centuries. “Sean Williams and Craig Ervine, who both missed the one-off Test against Bangladesh due to Covid-19-related issues, have not been included in the ODI squad,” said ZC in a statement. “Although the duo returned negative coronavirus test results this week, the ZC medical team is making frantic efforts, to ensure the two senior players first complete further health and fitness assessments, before they can be allowed to join the squad, in the bio-secure bubble.” The Chevrons, however, received a timely boost, with the return to the team of Sikandar Raza, who had been sidelined, by a bone marrow infection, since March. Raza returned to the cricket field, for the first time in four months, when he featured in the warm-up game at Takashinga Sports Club, on Wednesday. He scored 24 runs, from 40 balls, before falling to Mosaddek Hossain. The 34-year-old last featured for Zimbabwe in March this year, when the Chevrons played two Tests and three T20Is against Afghanistan, in United Arab Emirates. He got ill soon, after the tour, and twice went under the surgeon’s knife, after a suspected tumor, was discovered in his right arm. Raza has been on rehabilitation since then. Zimbabwe also welcomed back Tendai Chatara, who has not played an international match, since he suffered a right upper-arm injury, during the tour to Pakistan, in November last year. He was joined back in the fold by Ryan Burl. The 27-year-old has recovered, from a right knee sprain, to make the squad. Luke Jongwe, who last played an ODI match in January 2016, has also been selected. Timycen Maruma, who has struggled to hold his fort in international games, continued to puzzle the selectors, when he scored a run-a-ball 59, in the practice match. This could have helped him earn a place, in the 16-man squad, against public opinion. The series pitting Zimbabwe against Bangladesh is part of the Super League. The 13-team league competition will see the top seven sides, plus India as the hosts, qualifying directly, for the World Cup. The remaining five teams, along with five Associate sides, will play in a qualifier tournament, from which two other teams, will go through to the global showcase. The second and third ODI matches of the series will be played on Sunday and Tuesday. This will be followed by a three-match T20 series, scheduled to be played on July 23, 25 and 27. The matches will be played behind closed doors at Harare Sports Club, with no spectators allowed in the ground, as part of the strict Covid-19 restrictions, in place for the tour.
