The Herald LONDON. — The financial mess that Spanish football giants Barcelona find themselves firmly in the midst of is truly staggering. Over the years, they have been dragged into mountains of debt and now, under new leadership, the painful road to recovery has begun. Unfortunately for them, there is no easy fix. In layman’s terms, Barcelona now have their hands tied behind their back, and they will be unable to register any new players — including Lionel Messi — unless they make swingeing cuts. They must make drastic savings of around €200million (£170m) this summer, or they will remain in a bind ahead of next season. That will see first-team stars offloaded and slashes in salaries as part of La Liga’s crackdown. — Mailonline
