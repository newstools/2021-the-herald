The Herald KINGSTON. — Usain Bolt claims the current crop of athletes aiming to take his mantle as the world’s new Sprint King, have a distinct advantage that he was not afforded. Bolt says advances in spike technology that could help wipe out his world records are “laughable”. He also reckons the new shoes give an unfair advantage to sprinters over other athletes who are not wearing them. Advancements in shoe technology and the benefits they bring athletes are nothing new, with carbon-plated, thick-soled shoes attributed to a slew of records in distance running in recent times. However, manufacturers are now starting to turn their attentions to technology advancements in spikes for sprinters. Although there is less time in a race for the advantages to make significant impacts — it is still enough to make a difference. Bolt — the 100m and 200m world record holder — competed in Puma spikes throughout his career. The 34-year-old claims that manufacturers were often blocked in the past for trying to develop shoes that gave athletes a competitive advantage. The eight-time Olympic gold medallist says he was stunned to learn that was no longer the case. “When I was told about it I couldn’t believe that this is what we have gone to, you know what I mean, that we are really adjusting the spikes to a level where it’s now giving athletes an advantage to run even faster,” Bolt said in an interview from Kingston, Jamaica. “It’s weird and unfair for a lot of athletes because I know that in the past they (shoe companies) actually tried and the governing body said ‘no, you can’t change the spikes’, so to know that now they are actually doing it, it’s laughable,” the eight-time Olympic champion said. — Yahoo Sport
