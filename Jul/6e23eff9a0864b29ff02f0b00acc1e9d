The Herald Herald Reporter Murehwa district medical officer Dr Reginald Gwisai, who succumbed to Covid-19 complications on Tuesday will be buried today in Featherstone. Provincial medical director for Mashonaland East, Dr Paul Matsvimbo made the announcement yesterday saying his colleague would be buried in line with laid down health protocols. “He died on Tuesday morning at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, and I have been told he will be buried in Featherstone,” said Dr Matsvimbo. He is the second doctor to die recently from Covid-19. While vaccination slashes the risk of infection and death by around 90 percent, it does not eliminate the dangers which is why even when vaccination rates are very high other precautions have to be taken. But as countries try to reach herd immunity, infection chains become very short, so any focus of infection quickly dies out.
