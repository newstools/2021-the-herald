ZIMBABWE national football team trialist Charlton Mashumba is facing a bleak future in South Africa as he is one of the players that have been targeted to be released by GladAfrica Championship outfit, Polokwane City. According to reports, the Limpopo side have decided not to renew contracts of a number of their big-name players, including Mashumba, ahead of the 2021/22 season. Rise and Shine were relegated from the top-flight at the end of the 2019/20 campaign and failed to bounce back into the DStv Premiership last season, after finishing in 12th position. According to a report from KickOff.com, the Limpopo outfit are believed to be looking to cut costs and rebuild a new, youthful team after failing to achieve their targets using the experienced players. Mashumba, who turns 29 in December this year, is among the list of the players to be released. The list includes Mozambican international and former PSL Player of the Season Elias Pelembe and Zambian national team goalkeeper Cyril Chibwe. Others on the chopping list are right-back Mpho Mvelase (32), Nicholas Motloung (25), right-winger Vusimuzi Mngomezulu (26) and central midfielder Mthokozisi Nene (33).
