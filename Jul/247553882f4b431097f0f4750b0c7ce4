The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE international chess master, Rodwell Makoto, will face an acid test when he takes on Belarusian Grand Master, Vladislav Kovalev, at FIDE, which gets underway this weekend in Sochi, Russia. Makoto, who is highly rated back home, battles Kovalev, whose ratings are 2637 for standard, and 2573 in blitz. The Zimbabwean’s Fide rating stands at 2352. Although the Belarusian’s ratings are higher than that of Makoto, there is a lot of hope from the players in Zimbabwe, he will give his opponent a good run. One of the top local players Emerald Mushore, believes Makoto has got a chance to make it into the next round. “While others just consider the rating, and are ruling out Makoto, looking at the ratings differences, I do not,’’ said Mushore. “Makoto was expecting to have this stiff competition, as he mentioned about it earlier on, however, he was quick to say that he was equal to the task.” Kovalev had a dire wild card, from the FIDE president, Arkday Dvokovich, with the young player having a point to prove, to the 33-year-old Makoto. Makoto, however, will be carrying the hopes of the country after he becomes the second player, to represent the country, after veteran Robert Gwaze. Makoto went through after the Zimbabwe chess team produced some good results in Batumi, Georgia, where they finished in the top 100. They were the second best African country, after Egypt, who came first. The games will be played in the Gaspron Mountain resort area of Sochi, Russia.
