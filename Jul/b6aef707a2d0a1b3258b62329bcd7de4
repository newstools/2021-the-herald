The Herald Mashonaland West Bureau Government has directed the immediate revamping of all nursing schools’ students accommodation and learning facilities to improve the welfare of nursing students. The call came from Health and Child Care Deputy Minister Dr John Mangwiro during his tour of 100-student-capacity Chinhoyi Provincial Hospital’s Multidisciplinary Training School at the weekend. “The students must be looked after; they shouldn’t be cooking in their dormitories, which is dangerous to them as some use gas stoves. These hostels were not meant for cooking and it should be stopped henceforth. We are going to ensure that student nurses are kept safe at every nursing school. “Here at Chinhoyi Provincial Hospital, we have directed the authorities to start looking after the student nurses. Meals should be cooked by the school at one place and entertainment has to be offered as well.” Dr Mnagwiro said Vice President and Health and Child Care Minister, Dr Constantino Chiwenga, was emphasising on health workers’ welfare.
