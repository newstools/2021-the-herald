ZIMBABWE senior netball national team player Claris Kwaramba has urged fellow players to continue with individual training as sport remains on suspension in the country. There hasn’t been much activity for netball since last year in March and it has been a difficult time for players who are used to be on court constantly training and playing in competitive games.
Although she misses group training, Kwaramba says she is making some effort to at least keep herself fit as sport is currently suspended because of the Covid-19 pandemic. “It’s not easy, we are used to train as a team…motivating and pushing each other but because of the lockdown, l train on my own everyday but only physical training. “Let’s keep training, take good care of ourselves, above all keep praying and mask up,” said Kwaramba. The Platinum Queens player, however, said there is a lot to be done when they finally get the nod to resume activities. “Well I think there is really a lot to do because not everyone is training. Other African countries have so many players who are playing in the UK and obviously they were playing games, training making combinations,” said Kwaramba. Kwaramba, who plays wing defence and goal defence, was the youngest player in the senior team that made it’s maiden appearance at the World Cup in 2019. The Gems are hoping for another dance at the World Cup in 2023. With South Africa hosting, Zimbabwe wouldn’t want to miss the global competition.
