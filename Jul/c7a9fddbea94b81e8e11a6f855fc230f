THE first part of the docuseries on karate champion Samson Muripo premieres today with the producers behind the project hopeful that the story will inspire youths from across the continent. The four-part docuseries will be on Yakontent platforms every Friday, until the final part on August 6. It was produced by Yakontent through their Yako Story Initiative. The docuseries focuses on Muripo’s life experience, from before he became a karateka, and his journey to winning two world titles. Apart from being crowned world champion twice, Muripo has done well at several international competitions. Yakontent chief executive Tafadzwa Antony Munyaradzi believes the story will inspire youths from all walks of life. “When I sum up the impact of the story, I would sum it up like, this is a story of hope, possibility, self-belief, mastery, discipline, determination, perseverance and hard work. “And having said that I would also say that the shihan Samson Muripo Yako Story shows Zimbabweans and African youths from all over, and from all walks of life that it is possible to go beyond your barriers or to start wherever you start from and achieve greatness,” said Munyaradzi. Muripo’s first world title was in 2009 when he won the middleweight category Kyokushin Union World Cup in Japan to become the first African to win a world title. The second title was in 2019 when he was crowned champion at the sixth Kyokushin Karate World Cup in Moscow, Russia.
