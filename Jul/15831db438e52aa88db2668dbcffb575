The Herald Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter DYNAMOS coach, Tonderai Ndiraya, has heaped praise on his team’s defence which he believes has been the team’s mainstay, in the Chibuku Super Cup. The only time they conceded was via an own goal, by their defender Emmanuel Jalai, in a 1-1 draw against CAPS United. Goalkeeper Taimon Mvula, captain Patson Jaure, Frank Makarati, Godknows Murwira and defendive midfielder Trevor Mavhunga, have been a wall of resistance. “I don’t know how many we have conceded so far. I think we let in one goal, in six matches, and scored eight,’’ said Ndiraya. “The statistics are quite good but, as a coach, I still expect my team to improve, to be more comfortable when in possession and I still want my team to be more clinical. “We must bear in mind that we are coming from a break and that break is what I felt really took us some few steps back. “I thought our team was beginning to get together but we were a bit slow (against Herentals) and that is expected in football. “But, I am quite happy that, even under those circumstances, we still went on to keep a clean sheet and collect maximum points. “We still managed to put in a good shift that has taken us to 14 points, which I think is really pushing us up towards the quarter-finals. “The objective was to qualify for the quarter-finals and with where we are now I think it’s a good cushion.’’ The Glamour Boys will have an off-weekend, again, after the Sports Commission halted the Chibuku Super Cup, until further notice. This follows the tighter measures, unveiled by the Government this week, to try and contain the spread another outbreak of Covid-19.
