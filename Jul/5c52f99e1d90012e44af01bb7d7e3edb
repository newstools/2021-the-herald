AS Triathlon Zimbabwe up their efforts to explore other areas, they are looking at starting the duathlon events this month in Harare. The have set July 25 for their first event in Mount Pleasant and another event is expected on August 1 at Borrowdale Brooke and have already applied for clearance from the Sports Commission. Duathlon consists of running and cycling. Triathlon Zimbabwe president David Ellis said the two events are meant to kick start the programme while they fine tune the calendar. “We have scheduled events and applied to the Sports Commission for an event at Mount Pleasant for the 25th of July and another for the 1st of August at Borrowdale Brooke. This is to kick-off whilst we refine the season calendar,” Ellis said. The national association is targeting to grow their wings and for the duathlon events, they are not just looking at their usual members but also those that are interested from other sport codes. They are also hoping to get into schools when the environment allows since schools sport is on hold at the moment because of the Covid-19 pandemic. “I think we will definitely get support from our traditional database. But we are also looking to promote the events to athletes in the cycling and running fraternities, and possibly the schools whose traditional competitions are suspended at present. “This is our overall strategy to diversify and attract more competitors,” said Ellis.
