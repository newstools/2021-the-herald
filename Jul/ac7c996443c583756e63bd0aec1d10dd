The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo Senior Lifestyle Writer The term “make-up” can have different meanings when put into context. Some say it refers to cosmetics applied to the body. The act of the said application often has different connotations from person-to-person. Make-up is by and large deception. It alters the real look into the favoured or fashionable one. It gives options. Others say the beauty industry is worth billions of dollars because of make-up and is full of artists and brands that are often praised as much as critiqued by some users like popular Sorvino. One of the earliest societies date make-up usage back to 6 000 BC, claimed by the Egyptians. Egyptian men and women were known for creating and wearing face make-up made from natural resources. Early into the 20th Century, make-up was considered “questionable” and the “middle classes in particular felt make-up was unacceptable in polite society and remained in the alms of prostitutes and actresses”. From the book, “The story of make-up”, during the women’s suffrage movement, women reclaimed make-up and spoke out against these stigma by wearing red lipstick, which became “a symbol of strength, power and liberty during the suffrage movement; before it always carried sexual undertones”. Later on, with the emergence of Hollywood, high fashion and glamour, make-up began to rise in use and popularity. From movie stars to models, make-up began to be used to enhance beauty and became more marketed to the masses. And locally and internationally, the make-up industry is constantly growing especially in film, television, theatre and photography. There is more demand than ever as more and more productions are made. Most of us have seen an incredible example of an actor getting transformed into an amazing character or creature. Have you probably wondered how professionals in the industry make actors unrecognisable? It is the prosthetic make-up or the special effect. Celebrities and television stars on red carpet events go through a lot to turn heads of many and keep fans glued to their screens. Some invest a lot from their floor-length gowns, skimpy costumes and even make-up to win the hearts of many. World over, the Kardashians and Beyonces of this world, get an extra edge through the hands of make-up artists who give them confidence. At Zimpapers Television Network (ZTN) there is one unheralded special effects make-up artist Juelz, who is no doubt one such beautician with the Midas touch. She has defied her touch to become one of the capital’s most sought-after special effects artists. It was surprising to note that when most girls are busy trying to look pretty with art, Juelz, real name Juliet Guveya has a different feel altogether when it comes to make-up. She can be an Avatar, Lion, Flower, Butterfly or even an aeroplane with just make-up. The unassuming, yet friendly, Juelz reflected with pride in an interview with The Herald on Saturday Lifestyle about her journey. “My name is Juliet Guveya. I am 30 years old and a single mum to an amazing little girl,” she said. “Currently, I’m working for a television station (ZTN) as a make-up artist. I went to Murewa High School for my O Levels and finished my A Levels at Trust Academy and Speciss College, respectively. I proceeded to Women’s University to do a degree in Psychology but I dropped out along the way to pursue other things.” <img class="size-full wp-image-557681 aligncenter" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-02-at-22.02.28.png" alt="" width="612" height="828" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-02-at-22.02.28.png 612w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-02-at-22.02.28-266x360.png 266w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-02-at-22.02.28-503x680.png 503w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /> She chose to focus on her passion more than any other business. “I have always been a person who loved make-up and I remember in high school, I would get into trouble with my teachers for wearing make-up. I had what I called my basic go-to look, which was my baby powder on top of a vanishing cream and a lot of lip gloss. “Actually, my make-up journey began in 2015 when I realised that I had a passion for make-up. My first gig was my friend’s sister’s wedding that glammed her bridesmaids and right afterwards I just then decided that’s what I wanted to do,” she explained. Like any other profession, Juelz shared with this publication some of the people she used to look up to. “My role model is renowned make-up artist Jackie Mgido. She is a successful businesswoman and Hollywood make-up artist that introduced the make-up industry in Zimbabwe. She is a game-changer; her story inspires me that if I’m persistent enough you can be whatever I want to be. Now she is reigning supreme in the United States and representing Zimbabwe on the highest level,” she said. Unlike some of her peers in the same business, Juelz believes she has her own touch which makes her unique. “My art is diverse, from prosthetics to make- up for television and films, magazines, photo shoots, bridal, fashion shows, runways. I don’t limit myself to specialise in a certain type of look. “I am a visionary and a creative genius that I use different types of makeup to express different types of art,” cited Juelz. However, Juelz’ career path is both rewarding and challenging at times. “The major challenge I am facing is that some people fail to understand and appreciate the type of art I specialise in. “The film and television industry is not doing so well, that you could actually get as many gigs. Some people consider makeup as a luxury that not everyone can afford to get their faces done be it for an event, or whatever the occasion. Only things like photo-shoots and weddings are a little bit rewarding, just a small number of people are becoming more appreciative.” Owing to her magical touch, Juelz has worked with some of the household names that are making it big internationally. “I have worked with Hollywood actor Rick Cosnett of the popular Vampire Diaries, Tongai Chirisa, Danai Gurira, Brian Nhira, Davido, Beenie Man, Cassper Nyovest, Tammy Moyo and Ammara Brown among others,” recalls Juelz. Despite the potential of their sector being overlooked by policy-makers, Juelz reckons a lot needs to be done for them to be recognised. “The relative authorities and influential people should invest in the makeup and beauty industry by opening up schools that specialise in different aspects of the art of makeup and even take it to university level just like in places like South Africa and Nigeria. However, I have noticed that there are few colleges offering classes on makeup but it’s on a shallow level. I learned most of my craft by taking online classes. I think that one of the major things that needs to be done that pertains to my job is to work on our film industry and it used to bloom back in the days of films like ‘Yellow Card’ and ‘Neria’ among others, but now there is not much going on.” She also opened up on some of the game-changers she would like to work with in future. “Given a chance, I would like to work with Jackie Mgido since her craft is also diverse and she’s doing amazing in Hollywood and I like the fact that she’s a Zimbabwean making a difference. “There is a lot that goes in terms of what equipment I use for my art from foundations, face paints, brushes, prosthetics peace made from latex, moulding wax, glues etc.” After styling many people, Juelz has her own definition of beauty. “Beauty is graceful, beauty inward, deep within the soul and expressed on the outside,” she says.
