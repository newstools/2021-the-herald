THE Zimbabwe women’s national rugby side, the Lady Sables, left the country this morning for Uganda where they will take part in the Rugby Africa Pool C games at the Kyadondo Stadium in Kampala. Uganda’s women’s side, the Lady Cranes, will play Zimbabwe in two reverse fixtures to determine who progresses to the next round of the competition, which serves as a World Cup qualifier. The first encounter is set for Wednesday and the second game will be played on Sunday. For the Lady Cranes, this will be the first competitive match they will be playing since 2019, the year that marked the nation’s return to international women’s rugby in the Elgon Cup.
