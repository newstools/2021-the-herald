MIGHTY Warriors and Harare City striker Rudo Neshamba is expected to play in the CAF Women’s Champions League after she was loaned out Black Rhinos Queens. The army side is beefing up their squad as they are looking at making a strong impression in the inaugural women’s continental club tournament. The Zimbabwean representatives will first compete against other southern region teams in zonal qualifiers scheduled for next month.
The winner from the regional tournament will go on to represent the region, at the CAF Women’s Champions League finals, in Egypt in November. Although the women’s football champions are yet to get clearance from the Government to resume training for the zonal qualifiers, they have boosted their playing personnel. Already they have acquired Marjoury Nyaumwe on a loan deal from sister club Correctional Queens. They have also roped in the duo of Purity Mugayi and Concelia Madotsa from Faith Drive. Neshamba and Harare City goalkeeper Cynthia Shonga and defender Agnes Tumbare are the latest players to join the army side on a six-month contract. Black Rhinos Queens were selected to represent Zimbabwe in the inaugural Women’s Champions League, on account of them having won the 2019 Super League. No competitive football was played last year. Black Rhinos Queens coach Kuda Matuwi says it has been difficult to prepare for the zonal qualifiers without adequate training time. The coach hopes the experienced players will give an added edge to his team. The team lost their captain at the beginning of the year Emma Msipa, who joined a Spanish club.
