The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Senior Sports Reporter THE National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe have set a new coaching structure that will involve more coaches in the selection of national teams. The new set up will be headed by a national head coach. He will be supported by national event coaches for sprints, middle and long-distance, throws and jumps. “NAAZ sets new coaching structure headed by a national head coach. The head coach will be supported by national event coaches. The four events areas are sprints, middle and long (distance), throws and jumps. “So below the head there will be five national event coaches for sprints events, covering 100m, 400m, hurdles and relays. “Four national event coaches for throws, covering discus, shot put, javelin and hammer. Four national event coaches for jumps, covering high jump, long jump, triple jump and pole vault. And four national event coaches for middle and long distance, covering 800m, 10 000m and marathons. “It is these coaches of specific areas that recommend an athlete for national team selection in conjunction with provincial coaches and other coaches that feel should be consulted,” said NAAZ president Tendai Tagara. The same team will prepare a selection criteria for athletes into national teams. “However, athletics is very easy to select as the athletes performance selects themselves. Usually your seasonal best and recent performance determine your selection rather than history,” said Tagara.
