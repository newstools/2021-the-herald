The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — Former Kaizer Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt has explained the reasons behind his shock move to Chippa United. Less than three months after parting ways with Amakhosi, four-time PSL winning coach Hunt has made a prompt return to the top-flight after being appointed as the new manager for Gqeberha-based side Chippa United. The 56-year-old tactician succeeds Lehlohonolo Seema as the man at the helm for the Chilli Boys. He has penned a contract that will see him spend the next two seasons at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium. Hunt, whose CV includes league-winning campaigns with SuperSport United and Bidvest Wits, surprised many with his move to a Chippa United team that narrowly avoided relegation last season. “I see this as a massive challenge, and one that really excites me,” the ex-Chiefs boss said in a press release following his appointment. The club has also confirmed that Roy Limongelli has been brought in to fill an administrative support role alongside Hunt, with the duo having worked together at Wits, and that the veteran coach’s assistant will be announced in due course. — KickOff.com
