The Herald Grace Chingoma Senior Sports Reporter CAPS United players this morning received their second dose of Covid-19 vaccination at Belvedere clinic. The club’s players, technical members and officials got their first jab a month ago at Braeside Clinic. But they were forced to wait a little bit longer due to shortages of vaccines. The Premier Soccer League are in vaccination drive, urging the top-flight players to get vaccinated. The league hope armed with vaccination statistics, they would be able to lobby the Government to allow the Chibuku Super Cup return after it was suspended last week. A larger chunk of clubs have received either first or both doses. CAPS United official, Morton Dodzo, said they will submit full information to the PSL. “Everyone from players to officials were vaccinated. We even invited some supporters today and they were vaccinated. Our team doctor facilitated the program. We had to go to a different health facility for second doses due to shortages. “We are now complying our list for submission with PSL, who in turn will sent the information to the relevant authorities,” he said. So far 95 players have been vaccinated and clubs such as Dynamos and Black Rhinos have already been inoculated.
