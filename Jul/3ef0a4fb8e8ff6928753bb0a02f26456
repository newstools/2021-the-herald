The Herald Herald Reporter Vice President Constantino Chiwenga has described the late Zanu PF chairman for Matabeleland South, Cde Rabelani Choeni, as a strong and revolutionary cadre with proven liberation war credentials. Cde Choeni was buried yesterday after succumbing to Covid-19 complications last Friday. In his condolence message, VP Chiwenga said Cde Choeni’s passing was a grim reminder of the high transmissibility of the Covid-19 Delta variant now afflicting the country. “It was with a heavy heart that I learnt about the untimely death on Friday last week, of our Zanu PF provincial chairman for Matabeleland South, Cde Rabelani Choeni, after succumbing to Covid-19 related complications. “His passing on under such circumstances is a grim reminder to us all of the high transmissibility of the Delta variant which we are experiencing under the third wave.” VP Chiwenga said the country had lost many of its citizens to the deadly variant, reminding people of the need to adhere to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Government containment measures. “Matabeleland South Province has lost a strong revolutionary cadre with proven liberation war credentials who had provided stability in the party. Both our party and the nation at large are poorer without him as the country continues to lose the early crop of our freedom fighters of the second Chimurenga. “Their patriotism should continue to be a source of inspiration to the new generation of our young men and women.’’ “My sincere condolences to the Choeni family, especially to his wife Lydia and the children for losing a spouse, father and mentor. I join them in grief,” said VP Chiwenga.
