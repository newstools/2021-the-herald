The Herald LONDON. — Jordan Henderson’s future remains uncertain with European football giants Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid reportedly monitoring the situation as he enters his final year of his contract at Liverpool. The England international, who celebrated a decade at the Merseyside club last month, is currently on holiday following his role with the national team at Euro 2020. According to The Athletic, despite his service to the club, there remains a sense of uncertainty as to whether a new deal can be agreed, leaving the door open to a potential move away from Anfield. This situation mirrors that of fellow midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum, who failed to agree terms on a new contract last summer. He eventually left the club on a free transfer when his contract run out at the end of last season, before signing a three-year deal with Paris Saint-Germain. — Metro
