Officiating the opening of the recording studio at the Museum of African Liberation in Harare, Minister Mutsvangwa, who also partly recorded her history during the liberation struggle, said the purpose of the studio was to effectively collect oral evidence from various stakeholders who took part, directly or indirectly in the Zimbabwean liberation struggle. “The main objective of the recording studio is to accord an opportunity to all and anyone who took part or witnessed the liberation war to come up and have their stories recorded, archived and curated in the Museum of African Liberation,” she said.
