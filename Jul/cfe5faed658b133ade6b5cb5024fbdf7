The Herald KHAMA BILLIAT has said he is at the right club, despite all the challenges he has experienced, at Kaizer Chiefs. The Zimbabwean forward has battled injury and loss of form and hasn’t made the impact, which many expected, when he joined the Amakhosi. There has been speculation about his future, with some reports indicating Billiat was set to leave the Glamour Boys, this year. However, he has reassured the Chiefs fans that he feels he is at the right club. “I’m at the right place, at the right time and I’m surrounded by the right people, (the) right management and I’m at the right club,” he told the club’s media department. Billiat has been a notable absentee for Chiefs, in the latter stages of the season, owing to injury. But, it appears Chiefs have coped just fine, without the Zimbabwean, salvaging a top eight finish in the DStv Premiership, and reaching the CAF Champions League final. There was speculation, regarding the 30-year-old’s future, with his contract having expired on June 30. However, it was reported that Chiefs have since exercised the option, on his contract, to extend their relationship. Now, with one of the team’s biggest matches in history, just days away, Billiat has sent a strong message to the club’s supporters. “We are blessed to be where we are, we actually give credit to everyone, the supporters who’ve been with us, through the hard times, and right now we are in the final,’’ Billiat said. “We are plus-minus 90 minutes away from the biggest trophy that any other club in Africa would want to have. “We (are) still down to earth, we are still maintaining professionalism. “We still want to do the best the coach wants us to do, from training, knowing very well we could work on one or two things that could make a difference, during the game. “It’s looking good, and you wouldn’t see this coming but being where we are right now, being in the final again, I give credit to God, everything happens for a reason.’’ — Sports Reporter/Laduma
