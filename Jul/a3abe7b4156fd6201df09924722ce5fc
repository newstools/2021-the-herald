The Herald George Maponga in Masvingo
World Boxing Federation champion Charles Mayuchi has promised his legion of fans fireworks in his much-anticipated fight with Ugandan Mahommed Sebyala at Flamboyant Hotel tomorrow afternoon. Manyuchi will be defending his sole belt and also fighting for the WABA World Supreme and World Professional Boxing Federation titles held by the Ugandan in the duel dubbed “Duel of the Doom.” If Manyuchi can outgun his Ugandan rival into a fight that is expected to kick-off at 4.30pm he will take home all three belts in the middleweight division. Sebyala has been in Masvingo since the beginning of the week and has largely refused to give much ahead of the fight that will be broadcast on ZBC-TV and also live-streamed on several media channels. Charles Manyuchi Boxing Academy are promoters of the fight that will also see other pugilists sparring in the ring. Speaking after a weigh-in at the venue this morning Manyuchi thanked Government for allowing the fight to go ahead despite the Covid-19-induced lockdown. Manyuchi promised to stand toe to toe with his Ugandan rival and bring entertainment and pride to Masvingo and the nation at large. The Ugandan has already stoked fires ahead of the fight by declaring that he will knock out Manyuchi in the first round. When The Herald visited the venue of the fight, the stage was already being set up ahead of the duel with Manyuchi exuding confidence that he will take the Ugandan all the way in the bout. Manyuchi is pencilled to fight in Dubai if he wins against Sebyala tomorrow with the Zimbabwean stopping short of promising that he will knock out Seybala.
