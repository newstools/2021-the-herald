The Herald LONDON. — Arsenal have cancelled their pre-season tour due to Covid concerns the day before they were due to fly to the USA. Mikel Arteta’s side were set to jet across the Atlantic this week to step up their preparations for the new English Premier League football season. But, according to The Athletic, a small number of positive cases in the Arsenal camp have forced them to cancel the tour. All cases are understood to be asymptomatic, with the club looking at alternative plans to get up to speed before the new season gets underway against Brentford on August 13. The Gunners were due to take part in the Florida Cup, playing two games and competing alongside Inter Milan, Everton and Millonarios. They were set to face Inter on Sunday before a second game against July 28 against the winner of Everton vs Millonarious. A round of testing on Monday showed up the positive results, with the squad again tested on Tuesday before they were due to fly out yesterday. However the trip has been cancelled, as has the game against Inter Milan that was scheduled for Sunday night in the Florida Cup. The winners of that game, at the Camping World Stadium in Orlando, would have faced Everton or Colombian side Millonarios in the final on July 28. — The Mirror.
