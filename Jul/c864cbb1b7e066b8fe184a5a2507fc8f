The trial for State law officer Arthur Bosha, accused of consenting to bail for a suspected armed robber, Musafare Mupanhanga, without consulting his bosses was this morning further deferred to July 14 at the Harare Magistrates Court. The State alleges that sometime in September last year, Bosha was allocated a bail application case involving Mupanhanga by his superior and acting head of appeals Mr Edmore Makoto. It is alleged that Bosha unilaterally consented to granting of bail to Mupanhanga without consulting his superiors. In consenting to bail, Bosha is said to have disregarded standard operating procedures of the Attorney Generalâ€™s Office (Criminal Division), which dictate that applications and bail alterations should be done through the Area Public Prosecutor or the Public Prosecutor in Charge in consultation with the Chief Law Officer. According to basic procedures laid down on November 16, 2020, all consents to bail by prosecutors are to be approved by their superiors. The State alleged that Bosha showed favour to Mupanhanga, who was part of a notorious gang of armed robbers led by Musa Taj Abdul.
