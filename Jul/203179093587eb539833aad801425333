A member of the gang of armed robbers led by Godfrey Josi, who led the robbery at a Chinese nationalâ€™s residence at University of Zimbabwe Farm Compound and went away with US$60 000 has appeared at the Harare Magistrates Court. George Mangolobo, who was employed by the Chinese national as an interpreter, was not asked to plead to the charges when he appeared before Mr Dennis Mangosi, who remanded him in custody to July 30. Mr Mangosi advised Mangolobo to apply for bail at High Court. Mangolobo is alleged to have led Josi, Peter Mushipe, Bruce Muparadzi, Themba Mugabe, Zvidozvashe Zuda, Richard Mutanga, Benjamin Musasa, Chamunorwa Genge, Ephraim Jack Alphas, Valentine Mutasa, Lazarus Chinobhururuka and another only identified as Mambo Dhuterere to the Chinese house on June 15 where they robbed him at gun point. Some of the suspected armed robbers have since appeared in court on the same charges while Richard Mutanga died in hospital from injuries sustained while exchanging fire with police.
