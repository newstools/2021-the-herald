THE Zimbabwe Handball Federation will next week hold a Level One coaching course targeting more than 50 aspiring coaches. The course, to be held online, will be facilitated by ZHF technical director Farai Gwisai and will run from July 26 to 29.
Gwisai confirmed the development. “I am running a Level One coaching course from Monday to Thursday. It’s targeting all the coaches that are going to take up the beginners. “We have managed to get Zimbabwe Open University students who have got a requirement of having a coaching course before they complete their course. So we have got quite a number of them. They are around 30 to 40. “Then the rest are from clubs and other teachers around,” said Gwisai. The course outline includes introduction to handball, the qualities of a coach, handball formation and nutrition of a player. It will also focus on the basic motor skills of a player, the positioning and basically the rules interpretation of the game. “So we are targeting that these coaches will go to grassroots and introduce the game of handball. “And the reason why we have partnered with ZOU to make sure that we always facilitate courses with them, they are the people who are going to the grassroots as the physical education teachers. “So we should give them enough information concerning the coaching of handball,” said Gwisai. The ZHF technical director noted that they are working on having a partnership with the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Innovation, Science and Technology Development to facilitate such courses, and in turn it will benefit the federation in its development programmes.
