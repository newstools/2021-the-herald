The Herald Herald Reporter Vice President and Minister of Health and Child Care, Dr Constantino Chiwenga has joined President Mnangagwa in expressing condolences to the Haritatos family following the death of Cde Peter Haritatos. Cde Haritatos succumbed to Covid-19-related complications on July 11, joining more than 2 300 local Zimbabweans and more than four million across the globe who have succumbed to the pandemic. His funeral service is expected to take place at the Christian Orthodox Church in Harare on Saturday in strict compliance with Covid-19 containment measures. In his commiseration, VP Chiwenga described Cde Haritatos as a stalwart of the ruling Zanu PF party, and forthright in his ethical desire for a better life for all Zimbabweans regardless of colour or creed. “As the nation mourns the illustrious son of the soil, let us be emboldened by the rich legacy of selflessness, loyalty, diligent service and commitment to serve the generality of the people of Zimbabwe, that Cde Haritatos espoused and lived. “Cde Haritatos endured relentless racial abuse and denial of access to certain privileges that were received for the white minority. He was forthright in his ethical desire for a better life for all Zimbabweans regardless of colour or creed,” said VP Chiwenga.
