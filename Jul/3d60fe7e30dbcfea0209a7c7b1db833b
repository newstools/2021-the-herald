The Herald Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter PROMINENT Dynamos supporter Mollen Macheme, who was one of the survivors of the accident that claimed nine of her colleagues in Kwekwe five years ago, has died. Macheme died on Tuesday evening after a short illness.  The Harare Dynamos Supporters Association described her as one of their longest serving members. “It is with a heavy heart that we announce the passing on of “Bla Mo” Mollen Macheme, one of the longest serving members of the association, last night at her residence in Chitungwiza. “A very passionate and determined fan, Bla Mo stood up to be counted when anything DeMbare was involved. No words can atone the departure of this brave stalwart but we look to the heavens for comfort acknowledging that it is a journey one has to take some day. “May Her Soul Rest in Eternal Peace. Funeral details and the way forward will be communicated in due course,” said the association in a statement. A jovial character by nature, Macheme rarely missed Dynamos’ domestic games whether the Glamour Boys were playing at home or away. She is survived by her daughter, Tafadzwa.
