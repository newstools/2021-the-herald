The Herald LONDON. — Wimbledon says its courts are “as good as they have always been” in response to mounting criticism as players continued to suffer falls yesterday. Serena Williams and Adrian Mannarino retired injured on Centre Court following slips on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Australian Nick Kyrgios said the courts were a “joke” and too slow. Former British number one Tim Henman, a member of the All England Club (AELTC) board, told the BBC: “It’s about controlling the controllables.” Henman added: “In terms of the preparation of the surface — the science and the readings — we have all that data. Wimbledon will leave no stone unturned and we hope there will be no more injuries. The courts are as good as they have always been. “The one thing that has been different this year is the weather. The courts do not get the chance to dry out. Add to that the fact the roof has been closed for the first two days and that is why you will see some slipping and sliding.” Speaking on BBC TV, three-time champion Boris Becker said: “The courts haven’t been played on in two years. They are almost too perfect, too green and lush. “Having said that, I’ve seen slips and slides every year in the first couple of days. I don’t find it that unusual, it’s just that we haven’t been here (since 2019). We’re not used to seeing players slide like that. This is the grass court. It did rain a lot but the first couple of days it is always slippy.” Frenchman Mannarino led Roger Federer 6-4 6-7 (3-7) 3-6 4-2 when he was forced to retire through injury, with Federer suggesting the surface had become “more slippery under the roof” which was closed for large parts of the first two days at the Championships because of rain. — BBC Sport
