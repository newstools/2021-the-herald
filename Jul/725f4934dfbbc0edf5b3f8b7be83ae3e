An elderly Gutu woman has been arrested on allegations of killing her 19-year-old granddaughter over spending a night out, as police urge the public to use non-violent ways of settling issues. The incident occurred on Tuesday at Serima Village under Chief Serima. The woman (78) is expected to appear in court for murder. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the incident and expressed concern over the rise in murder cases. “Police is urging members of the public to resolve their disputes without the use of violence,” he said. “On July, 5, 2021, a Gutu woman aged 78 was arrested by police in connection with the murder of a girl aged 19 at Serima Village, Chief Serima. “The victim was assaulted with a stick and fell headlong on a steel bed over allegations of sleeping outside the homestead the previous night.”
Asst Comm Nyathi said police also arrested a Kwekwe man for allegedly stabbing his landlady’s brother with a knife in Mbizo Extension.
The victim had attempted to evict the suspect from his sister’s house. “Police in Harare are also investigating a case of suspected murder where a body was found along a stream bank near United Furniture Manufacturers along Coventry Road in Harare,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. “The body was lying facing upwards with burns. Meanwhile, the body is yet to be identified and was conveyed to Parirenyatwa Hospital for post-mortem.” Police in Epworth are investigating a case of baby dumping which occurred near Jacha Township on Sunday at around 1000hrs. An alert passerby observed what appeared to be an object wrapped in a blood-stained cloth in a gully. Investigations revealed that it was a body of a newly born baby boy. A report was made to the police and investigations are underway.
