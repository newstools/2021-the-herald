The Herald Herald Reporter Air Force of Zimbabwe Wing Commander Davison Mupurwa was promoted by President Mnangagwa to Group Captain with effect from June 21 and yesterday received his rank insignia at Air Force of Zimbabwe headquarters from AFZ commander Air Marshal Elson Moyo. Air Marshal Moyo said the elevation demonstrates the trust that the President has in Group Captain Mupurwa. “The elevation means a higher responsibility that demands good judgment, discipline, loyalty and hard work,” he said. “It is, thus, incumbent upon you to be diligent and prudent in exercising command and control in order to maintain sustainable security in Zimbabwe.” Group Capt Mupurwa is an ex-combatant who completed initial military training during the war at Takawira 2, Chimoio in Mozambique in 1977. He was attested into the AFZ on 20 July 1981 as an aircraftsman. Meanwhile, 15 other AFZ officers yesterday graduated after completing administration staff course at AFZ School of Academic Training, Manyame Air Base. Handing over certificates to graduates, AFZ chief of staff supporting services Air Vice Marshal Jacob Nzvede said staff development was key to the achievements of the AFZ mandate. “It is pleasing and commendable that the AFZ continue to resolutely discharge its mandate of proving quality training and development programmes for the workforce in order to have a competent force equal to the task,” he said. “The course was designed to familiarise officers with the opportunity to improve their knowledge of administrative issues within the force. It also sought to instil confidence and competence into the graduates, building on the skills and knowledge acquired from the cadet course and other foundation courses,” He called on the graduates to put the knowledge obtained to good use.
