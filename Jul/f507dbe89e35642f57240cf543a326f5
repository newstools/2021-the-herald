The Herald LONDON. — Cristiano Ronaldo has topped Instagram’s rich list as the celebrity thought to be able to charge more than anyone else for a sponsored post. The Juventus forward can charge advertisers US$1.6million (£1.2m) per post on his account, according to social media marketing firm Hopper HQ. Former Real Madrid star Ronaldo knocked wrestler-turned-actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson off the top spot. It is the first time Ronaldo has topped the list, which started in 2017. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner boasts 308 million Instagram followers. Johnson, who stars in the box office juggernaut Fast and Furious film franchise, has 250 million followers and can command just over US$1.52m (£1m) per post, while pop star Ariana Grande (US$1.51m) places third on the list. — BBC Sport
