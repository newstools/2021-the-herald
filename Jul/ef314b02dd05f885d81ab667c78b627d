RESIDENTS of Pomona and Vainona in Harare got a reprieve when the High Court this week blocked an electrical company from carrying out developments on a piece land allegedly donated to the community for recreational purposes. The residents, led by Mr Craig Joseph Guthrie and Mr Kenneth Peter Moores had approached the High Court on an urgent basis seeking an interim order stopping Lagrandy Electrical Industries Ltd from developing the area. The land was allegedly donated from a deceased estate to council on condition that it would continue being used as a recreational park for the benefit of residents of Pomona and Vainona. Council was accused of surreptitiously selling the land meant for a recreational park to Lagrandy despite objections from the residents who are beneficiaries of the piece of land. Justice Phildah Muzofa ruled in favour of the residents, saying the court could not ignore the fact that there is an investigation into the legality of the process leading to the acquisition of ownership by Lagrandy. She ordered the company to stop the developments pending the finalisation of the matter.
