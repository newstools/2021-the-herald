The Herald BARCELONA. — Ronald Koeman insists Lionel Messi is a “prime candidate” and the favourite to win this year’s Ballon d’Or award after yet another stunning season for club and country. Messi, who is currently a free agent, has won the coveted prize on six separate occasions — the most in history – with a seventh potentially taking him two clear of nearest rival Cristiano Ronaldo. He is once again in the frame for the award after finally winning international silverware with Argentina this summer, which saw him lift the Copa America in Brazil. And while he was only able to lift the Copa del Rey with Barcelona in a poor campaign for the club, Koeman believes his goalscoring exploits for club and country in a difficult season only enhance his chances of winning the award. — Mailonline
