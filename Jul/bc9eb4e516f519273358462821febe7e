The Herald Port-au-Prince. – Security forces in Haiti have shot dead four suspected killers of President Jovenel Moise and captured two others, the country’s police chief said on Wednesday, as the brazen assassination threatened to plunge the crisis-hit Caribbean nation deeper into chaos. Police General Director Leon Charles described the four people killed as “mercenaries” and said that security forces were locked in a fierce gun battle with the men who assassinated the president at his home overnight. “We blocked them en route as they left the scene of the crime,” Charles said in televised comments. “Since then, we have been battling with them.” “They will be killed or apprehended.” Moise, a 53-year-old former businessman who took office in 2017, was shot dead and his wife, Martine Moise, was seriously wounded when heavily armed assassins stormed the couple’s home in the hills above Port-au-Prince at around 1am local time on Wednesday (05:00 GMT). Bocchit Edmond, the Haitian ambassador to the United States, said the gunmen were well-trained “foreign mercenaries” and said they had masqueraded as US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents as they entered Moise’s guarded home under cover of darkness. The DEA has an office in the Haitian capital to assist the government in counternarcotics programmes, according to the US Embassy. Moise’s wife, Martine, was in a stable but critical condition and had been evacuated to Miami for treatment, the ambassador added. – Al Jazeera
