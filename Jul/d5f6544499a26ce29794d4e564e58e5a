THE Zimbabwe senior men’s rugby side, The Sables, will not be in their usual green and white jerseys when they play against Burkina Faso’s Stallions in the second Rugby Africa Pool D at Old Georgians Sports Club this afternoon. The Sables wil have a red strip jersey not the traditional Hooped Green and White jersey for the match that kicks off at 2pm. The change of uniforms was necessitated by a request from the match commissioner and referees who felt the Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso jerseys were too close with both teams having green and white on their jerseys. Being the home team and having an alternate strip close by, with our opposition not having an alternate strip with them it then fell on us to provide the alternate. The team will have nine changes to the starting XV as Brendan Dawson continues his search for winning combinations. Three of the changes are injury inspired, with the experienced duo of captain Hilton Mudariki and hooker Simba Mandioma unavailable due to hip injuries, while fullback Martin Mangongo suffered a neck injury.
