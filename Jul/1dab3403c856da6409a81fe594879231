The Herald Herald Reporter Vice President and Minister of Health and Child Care Dr Constantino Chiwenga has joined President Mnangagwa in mourning Chief Tshovani, born Hlaisi Mundau. Chief Tshovani succumbed to Covid-19 complications on Tuesday. “Indeed the nation has been plunged into mourning the dear departed son of the soil,” said VP Chiwenga. “We shall find comfort from the rich legacy of preserving our culture and uplifting the livelihoods of all indigenous Zimbabweans which the late Chief Tshovani stood for. “He was forthright in championing Government programmes, not only in the area under his jurisdiction, but also in the entire Chiredzi district and beyond,” he said. VP Chiwenga said he worked closely with the traditional leader when they embarked on a project of uplifting the Chilonga community through the revival of the irrigation scheme and the VP said during that period he showed he was a straightforward person. “I had the opportunity of working closely with the late Chief Tshovani on the resuscitation of Chilonga irrigation scheme among other projects. His work ethic was worth emulating. He also had an unflinching desire for the locals to contribute to the national economy through allocation of land for commercial agriculture in the Lowveld,” said VP Chiwenga. “Our prayers and thoughts are with the Mundau family, the Zimbabwe Chief’s Council and the nation at large during this difficult period. “We shall continue to draw inspiration from the moral and cultural astuteness which characterised the late Chief Tshovani’s life. He shall forever be sorely missed. May his dear soul rest in eternal peace.”
