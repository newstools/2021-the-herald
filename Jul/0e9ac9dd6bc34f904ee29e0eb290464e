The Herald Farirai Machivenyika Senior Reporter The Affirmative Action Group has partnered the Zimbabwe Congress of Students Union (ZICOSU) to initiate empowerment programmes targeting female students. AAG vice president Cde Annastancia Ndlovu today met ZICOSU leadership from the Women’s University in Africa where she urged students to take advantage of the various initiatives that have been put in place to empower youths. “President Mnangagwa has achieved so much in a very short space of time,” she said. “We say to you, make this achievement known and also explore the opportunities which have been availed by Vision 2030 and the National Development Strategy 1. “We are saying students must organise themselves and come to us as AAG. We can help them to venture into mining and different businesses. Take advantage that we are here for you. Vision 2030 must be a success story. “Nothing stops you from organising yourselves in groups or syndicates. We can help you to start an income generating project, it doesn’t matter that you are still studying, you can get into mining, agriculture, or retail. You don’t need to finish your university to become an entrepreneur. You can also supply the things that students want daily.” Cde Ndlovu said Government had established the Women Microfinance Bank and Empower Bank to fund women and youths’ projects. Speaking at the same briefing, ZICOSU president at Women’s University Tatenda Nhira hailed AAG for the idea, adding that there was need to empower the girl-child for the country to move forward.
