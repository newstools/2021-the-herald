The Herald LONDON. — When Lauren looks back on his long and successful football career, one moment stands out as the real starting point. It’s not his move to Arsenal or any of the six major trophies he won during his illustrious stay in England. It’s the Olympics of 2000 when he made history with Cameroon in Sydney, Australia, winning the gold medal after a thrilling penalty shoot-out success against Spain in the final. “The momentum for my career started at the Olympics, definitely,” the legendary Arsenal right-back tells Goal. “Being at the Olympics, winning that gold medal for Cameroon, and for Africa, it was just unbelievable. It was fantastic.” Football has a long history with the Olympics. It’s been included in every summer games as a men’s competition except 1896 and 1932. Despite that, it is not viewed by many as one of football’s most important tournaments and few ever mention it in the same breath as the World Cup, European Championship, Copa America or Africa Cup of Nations. But for Lauren, winning the gold medal at Sydney is up there alongside anything else he achieved during his years as a professional. “It was one of the best moments of my career,” he reveals. “And I tell you what, it’s now that I enjoy it the most. When I really think back to those days, I’m really aware of just how big that was. “It’s not just for the fact that I won it, but because of how many millions of people we brought happiness to as a team. “Millions of people were proud of what we did and what we achieved. That gold medal wasn’t just for me, it was for Cameroon and it was for Africa.” Cameroon went into the Olympics looking to repeat the success of Nigeria, who had become the first African nation to win a gold medal during the Atlanta Games four years earlier. Lauren travelled to Sydney having just signed for Arsenal, and the Cameroon squad, which included players such as Patrick Mboma, Patrick Suffo, Pierre Wome and a young Samuel Eto’o, were in confident mood. — Goal.com
