The Herald LONDON. — Collin Morikawa said it was “hard to grasp and take in” what he had achieved after winning the Claret Jug on his Open Championship debut on Sunday. The 24-year-old American golfer held off 2017 Open champion Jordan Spieth to triumph by two shots at Royal St George’s. In doing so he became the first man to win two different majors on debut. “It’s hard to look back at the two years that I have been a professional and see what I’ve done because I want more,” said the Californian. “I enjoy these moments, I love it, and I want to teach myself to embrace it a little more, maybe spend a few extra days and sit back and drink out of this (the Claret Jug). “When you’re in these moments and you truly love what you do, these are the best moments ever because the nerves push you to just be a better person.” — BBC Sport
