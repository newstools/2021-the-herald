The Herald Herald Reporter A Ministry of Industry and Commerce clerk has been arrested by the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc) for fraudulently issuing 350 vehicle licenses to importers of second-hand vehicles which did not qualify. The official, Andrew Matevere, has since appeared in court and was denied bail. In a statement on Monday, ZACC said: “The Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc) has arrested a Ministry of Industry and Commerce license clerk for issuing 350 motor vehicle import licenses to importers of second-hand vehicles that did not qualify under the recently gazetted SI89 of 2021.” Government has directed that vehicles that are older than 10 years be imported only after one has obtained a license from the Ministry of Industry. Since the start of the year, ZACC has intensified the fight against corruption, and 103 arrests made so far, with 79 dockets already submitted to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) for prosecution.
