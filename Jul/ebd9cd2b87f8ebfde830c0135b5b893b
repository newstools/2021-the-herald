The Herald CONGRATULATORY MESSAGE FROM THE ZANU PF POLITBURO MEMBER AND SECREATRY FOR EXTERNAL RELATIONS CDE SIMBARASHE S. MUMBENGEGWI TO MINISTER SONG TAO OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEPARTMENT OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA, (IDCPC) ON THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE CPC ON  1 JULY  2021. On behalf of the Department for External Relations and indeed on my own behalf we would like to extend our profound congratulations on the occasion of the 100th Anniversary of the Founding of the CPC. The centenary celebrations are certainly memorable; not only for the people of China and Zimbabwe but for Africa and the Globe. The strides the Communist Party of China (CPC) has made over the past century are breathtaking. ZANU PF has been focusing on its goal of achieving an Upper Middle Income Economy by 2030 (Vision 2030) making life better and more prosperous for our people as guided by our 2018 Election Manifesto. Despite the trying times we are in, programs are ongoing and being implemented by our government through National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) ZANU PF sincerely appreciates the hundreds of thousands of doses of Covid 19 vaccines already donated by the People’s Republic of China, which has enabled our country to successfully step up efforts to curb the spread of the Corona Virus pandemic. Our government and the ruling party ZANU-PF are extremely grateful to the CPC and the Chinese government for extending this generous gesture to the people of Zimbabwe. The kind gesture speaks volumes to the cordial relations between the two countries that date back to the 1960s when China provided material, political and diplomatic assistance to Zimbabwe during its fight against racist colonial rule. We are confident that the vaccines will help Zimbabwe counter the pandemic and play a critical role in ensuring the health and safety of our people. We appreciate exceptional fruitful cooperation in various fields between the CPC and ZANU PF, affirming that both sides will continue to work closely for mutual benefit. ZANU PF has a lot to learn from the achievements by the CPC and the two sides enjoy continuous and strong relations and have worked together to take on challenges resulting in win-win outcomes. With decades of friendship, the relationship between the ZANU-PF and the CPC has remained strong and steadfast. ZANU PF is grateful for the historical and successful cooperation with China under the CPC’s leadership and the growing support for Zimbabwe’s economic development. ZANU PF welcomes His Excellency President Xi Jinping’s decision to elevate our relationship from all-weather friends to that of Strategic Partnership. We wish the CPC and the People of China very happy Centenary celebrations. May the next hundred years be even more spectacular and fruitful. Long live the CPC Long the People’s Republic of China I thank you! Simbarashe S. Mumbengegwi
