ZIMBABWEAN teenage footballer Ethan Kachosa has been officially unveiled by English football side Sunderland. The 18-year-old recently signed his first professional contract with the Sunderland development side after parting ways with Leeds United Academy. Kachosa, who hopes to play for Zimbabwe in the future, took to the social media to celebrate the new development. “Delighted to sign my first professional contract at this great club,” wrote Kachosa on his Twitter. He was unveiled along with three other academy signings Cameron Jessup, Harrison Sohna, and Thomas Scott. “The quartet have signed respective two-year deals at the Academy of Light ahead of the new campaign,” said the club in a short statement. His previous club Leeds United also congratulated him on the new move. Kachosa featured for Leeds Under-23s in the EFL Trophy last season. He had been a consistent performer at Leeds where he won the Leeds United Academy Players Player of the Year award in 2019. “Congratulations to second-year scholar Ethan Kachosa who has signed his first professional contract with Sunderland! “Kachosa has made a great start at Sunderland scoring 3 goals in the Under-18 Premier League before making his PL2 debut. All the best, Ethan,” read the statement from Leeds United. Kachosa, who mainly plays at full-back, did not need much time to settle as he scored his first goal for the side on debut in the victory over Everton Under-18s recently.
