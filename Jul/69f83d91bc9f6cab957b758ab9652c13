ZIMBABWE Olympic Committee president Thabani Gonye says they continue encouraging their members to be vaccinated as they finalise preparations for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. The Games are scheduled to run from July 23 to August 8. Gonye said numerous changes have occurred since they began preparing for the Games in 2017, including the postponement due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the various protocols associated with the new normal. He said they continue encouraging their members that have not been vaccinated to do so, as the Games get closer. “This is the new normal which while vaccination has not been compulsory we have highly encouraged our athletes and officials and recommended (the) vaccination route for all our members as have been also guided by the IOC (International Olympic Committee) and the Tokyo 2020. “We do acknowledge that the majority of our members and athletes have been vaccinated. “But the few that have not been vaccinated we continue to encourage them to probably get vaccinated for the safety of themselves, the athletes and the people of Japan,” said Gonye. Zimbabwe is sending a small delegation of 18, made up of five athletes and 13 officials.
