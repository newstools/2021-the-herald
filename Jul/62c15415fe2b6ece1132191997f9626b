FORMER Sables fullback, Lungile Tshuma, has set up a foundation where he is offering talented students an opportunity to join United States-based universities. He now lives in Wales, Durban in South Africa, and St Louis, Missouri, in the United States. “I am a proud Zimbabwean,’’ he said. “The incredible opportunities I have experienced I credit them to sport, community and others who believed in me. “Our foundation exists to reward Zimbabwean student-athletes, with a full scholarship, to attend Lindenwood University, located in St Louis, Missouri, with the first student set for the 2022 incoming freshman class. “As Tshuma Foundation, we believe in genuine character, sound courage, and the yearning to be a part of something bigger than yourself. “We know legacy is something to be proud of so we want to support those who leave a place, and people, better than they found it. “We provide financial support to extraordinary role models so they can experience a new place with people from around the globe.’’ Tshuma believes it was through sport that he got to where he is today. “Having experienced these cultural immersions, I appreciate what various places can offer to one’s life. “I have also been blessed to travel to places like Hong Kong and Georgia to represent Zimbabwe, on the international sporting arena. “It was here, where my leadership skills were developed, tested, and polished. “Through this foundation, I want to empower the next generation of Zimbabweans that seek to have a positive impact on communities they engage with.”
