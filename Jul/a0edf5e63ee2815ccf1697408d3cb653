The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — Wilfred Mugeyi believes a foreign player being chosen as the best player in South Africa indicates a major issue. Mamelodi Sundowns and Namibian international, Peter Shalulile, became the seventh foreigner to be crowned the best player in South Africa, in the 22 years of the PSL era. For four seasons, prior to the last, locally-born players had been dominating the PSL Footballer of the Season award category. “Number one, it means the teams that bring in the players who become the best player are doing good business. They are bringing in quality into the league,” Mugeyi told KickOff.com. “But, at the same time, it’s going to affect especially Bafana Bafana, because the players that you think are good might not be playing enough games for them to be playing for the national team, because of the good foreign players. “So, it’s a disadvantage to Bafana. If you can say, ‘No, Mugeyi is scoring goals at Bush Bucks or whatever, but it’s affecting Brandon Augustine because, probably he will be sitting on the bench now and he is a good player. “But for me, I have to start because I’m scoring goals. That’s a disadvantage to other local players that are not able to play.” — KickOff.com
