The Herald Herald Reporter Zimbabwe Newspapers (1980) Limited yesterday donated groceries and foodstuffs to one of its support staff, a Zimcan security officer whose house was destroyed by fire in Epworth last month. Ms Taurai Alberto lost all her property and documents in the fire on June 25. The donation of maize meal, cooking oil, sugar, beans, washing powder and soap among others things was handed over by public relations manager Mrs Pauline Matanda. Food World has also partnered Zimpapers in donating groceries. Mrs Matanda said the donation was part of Zimpapers’ corporate social responsibility and creating the best way for a company to give back to society. “We were really pained with what happened to our colleague so we have decided to donate these foodstuffs, we also promise to contribute again in the near future, this is part of our social responsibility including our chief executive Mr Deketeke who recognises and react to fulfil the needs and demands of the community and the company’s employees,” said Mrs Matanda. Ms Taurai Alberto welcomed the gesture. “This donation is special to us, l lost all my properties and documents in that incident, you have come to save my life, thank you very much for remembering me Zimpapers, may God continue to pour more blessings in this company,” said Ms Alberto.
