A Chinhoyi man appeared in court on Friday for setting his boss’s two vicious pit-bull dogs on a seven-year-old boy, seriously damaging his face and legs. The man, Stanley Mwale (42) of 10776 Mapako Phase 2 in Chinhoyi, pleaded guilty when he appeared before Chinhoyi provincial magistrate Mr Tapiwa Banda charged with letting vicious dogs at large. He was fined $20 000 or 30 days in jail. Prosecuting, Mr Tinoziva Chipupuri told the court that on June 17 at around 11am, the minor ran towards the accused’s main gate after a misunderstanding with his grandfather, Mr Richard Zulu, for allegedly stealing some biscuits at a nearby market. Mwale heard the juvenile crying outside and opened the gate trying to establish what was happening before the vicious pit-bulls ran towards the minor before biting him on the forehead, upper lip and both legs. The man tried to restrain the dogs from further attacking the minor but was overpowered until he was helped by his workmate Mr Ackim Moenda. The minor’s parents filed a police report against the owner of the dogs, Mr Samuel Mugari, leading to Mwale’s arrest. Mr Mugari was not charged for vicarious liabilities and the boy’s family is presently seeking permanent body injuries’ compensation.
