The Herald SANDWICK. — Collin Morikawa won the 149th British Open yesterday, thanks to a final-round 66 that pushed him past third-round leader Louis Oosthuizen. It was Morikawa’s first Open title and second career major. Morikawa, 24, trailed Oosthuizen by one shot entering the final day at Royal St. George’s. On a clear day with little wind, Morikawa closed his front nine with three straight birdies to surge past Oosthuizen and into a lead he would never relinquish. On the final nine Morikawa drained several clutch 4-to-5-footers to save pars — including on the 15th and 16th holes — to preserve his lead and stave off pressure from Jordan Spieth, who shot 66 to finish two shots back. Morikawa won the 2020 PGA Championship, which fans did not attend due to the pandemic, so this week marked Morikawa’s first major title in front of crowds. It was also his first appearance in a British Open. Morikawa arrived in the U.K. early and competed in last week’s Scottish Open, which he credited for helping him prepare for the links-golf challenge that awaited him at Royal St. George’s. Oosthuizen had dominated the event for three rounds and led at the close of each day, but he made two bogeys on the front nine and never got anything going on the back. He shot one-over 71 and tied for third place. Spieth emerged as Morikawa’s closest pursuer for most of the afternoon. Seeking his fourth career major and second Open title, the 27-year-old was never able pull even with Morikawa. Needing a birdie on 18 to maintain a glimmer of hope, Spieth drove his tee shot into the heavy rough left of the fairway, punched to the back of the green and two-putted for a closing par. Jon Rahm, who won last month’s U.S. Open, shot 66 to tie for third with Oosthuizen. It was Rahm’s fifth straight top-10 finish in a major championship. Morikawa has now won two majors in eight total appearances. He collects an Open-record US$2.07 million for his victory. — Sports Illustrated
