The Herald LONDON. — Angry Arsenal fans had #ArtetaOut trending by half-time as the English club lost their opening game of pre-season to Hibs on Tuesday night. The Gunners were beaten 2-1 in Scotland with Emile Smith Rowe pulling one back with ten minutes to go. Manager Arteta fielded only TWO non-first team players, keeper Arthur Okonkwo and centre-back Harry Clarke. Okonkwo suffered a disastrous start to the game as he missed Cedric Soares’ poor back pass, after only 21 minutes. Martin Boyle went in to finish it off following the stopper’s mistake and sub Daniel MacKay then made it 2-0 on 69 minutes. After Smith Rowe’s consolation, some Arsenal fans were left fuming and took their anger out on Spaniard Arteta. — The Sun.
