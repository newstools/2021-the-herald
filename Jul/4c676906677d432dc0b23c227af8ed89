Cde Choeni (71) died at his rural home of Malusungani in Beitbridge District due to Covid-19-related complications last Friday. “As provincial party chairman, Cde Choeni led the party from the front, always championing its interests ahead of all else. He advocated peace, unity and development in Matabeleland South province and in our nation as a whole. “That progressive stance won him the respect of the province he led, and of us all. His departure is a great loss to the party and our nation. “On behalf of the party, Zanu PF, Government, my family, and indeed on my own behalf, I wish to express my heartfelt condolences to the Choeni family, especially to his wife Lydia and the children, following the loss of a loving partner, father, and mentor,” the President said.
