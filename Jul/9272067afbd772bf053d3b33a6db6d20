The Herald BRASILIA. — Lionel Messi predicted a tough showdown between Argentina and Brazil in the Copa America final and the Barcelona star cannot wait to face off against Neymar. Argentina beat Colombia 3-2 on penalties, after a 1-1 draw, in the semi-final, on Tuesday. Goalkeeper Emi Martinez was the hero, stopping three penalties, in the shootout. Neymar said before the game he hoped Brazil would be playing Argentina in the final and Messi responded to the comments from his former team-mate after his side beat Colombia. “Both of us are in the final, I know Neymar said it because we are friends and he wanted me to be there too,” Messi said. “It will surely be very close and difficult. ‘’We are aiming high, we managed to get the first objective of playing the final, playing all matches.’’ Messi set up Argentina’s opener after just seven minutes before Luis Diaz scored an impressive equaliser from a tight angle for Colombia in the 61st minute. In a post, via his Instagram account, Mesi said he was proud and happy. “Proud and happy to belong to this group, One more goal accomplished, thank you God for continuing to give me these moments. “We go for the glory. Draw, without words, you deserve it BEAST !!!” Martinez saved three penalties in the shoot-out with Messi leading the wild celebrations after the goalkeeper’s heroics. Messi and Martinez adopted a taunting strategy to throw Colombia off their game in the shoot-out, with the playmaker mocking Yerry Mina as he stepped up to take his kick before telling him, “Dance now. Dance now,” when he missed his shot. Martinez was in tears after the final spot-kick and paid tribute to Messi after the match, predicting he can lead Argentina to victory against Brazil. Argentina are chasing their first major piece of silverware since 1993 as Messi aims to finally add an international trophy to his collection. — Eurosport.
