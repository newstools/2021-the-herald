The Herald LONDON – World Athletics president Sebastian Coe has said he was concerned athletes hoping to compete at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics might be “swept along from rumour to rumour”. Coe made the comments after a report in The Times claimed the Japanese Government had conceded they could not stage the Games this year against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic. The report was swiftly denied by Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, the International Olympic Committee, International Paralympic Committee and Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Coe told ABC he was relieved the report was immediately dismissed as it reduced the impact on athletes. “I think the most important thing that I’ve witnessed in the last few hours, given the nature of that story, is it was immediately knocked down by the Japanese Prime Minister,” he told The Ticket programme. “It’s probably better for athletes, who I do have concerns about, that they’re not swept along from rumour to rumour and losing focus on what they need to really focus on.” Speculation surrounding the fate of Tokyo 2020 has intensified since the New Year, when a number of countries began to report a significant rise in coronavirus cases. This is thought to be largely caused by more transmissible variants of COVID-19 and forced Suga to declare a state of emergency in several areas, including the capital city Tokyo. – Insidethegames.com
