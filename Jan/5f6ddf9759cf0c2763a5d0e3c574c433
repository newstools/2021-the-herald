The Herald Takawira Dapi Arts Correspondent wedza-based upcoming gospel musician Apostle Chosen Jaji has said the area has been put on the map by the talent of sungura maestro Mark Ngwazi, who recently scooped first position on Radio Zimbabwe 2020 top 50. Jaji is following in such footsteps after releasing two new singles “Mwari ane Nyasha” and “Nyakutumbura Achema”, which he described as Covid-19 awareness campaign songs. In an interview, Jaji said the two singles were full of hope and joy. “The song ‘Nyakutumbura Achema’ castigates ritual killings against children as this causes unending pain to the mothers, especially when the murder is perpetrated by close family members,” he said. “This is the time to give hope to each other. I have penned the songs in line with Covid-19 regulations and restrictions. I am happy that our area, Wedza, is now recognised in the arts sector courtesy of Mark Ngwazi and there is a lot of undiscovered talent. “On ‘Mwari Ane Nyasha’ the song gives hope to the society that God does not leave us alone in such difficult times, but we should always call for Him and he has so many blessings and hears us.” Jaji is working on videos to promote and market the songs. “The videos will be coming out soon and I am happy that the Wedza community is getting much attention. Gone are the days when it was difficult for artistes like us to have an opportunity to shine,” he said. “It was much to do with being a Harare boy.” Jaji, who is a member of Apostolic Faith Mission in Zimbabwe, said he was on a campaign to educate people in his community about the global pandemic. “We are encouraging everyone to adhere to the Covid-19 regulations and restrictions as stipulated by the Government. Since it is difficult to access information in Wedza, it is our role as artistes to use the platform we have to educate and empower the community about this global pandemic. The best solution now is to stay at home,” he said.
