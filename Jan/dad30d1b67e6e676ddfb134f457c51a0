The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter ONE of Zimbabwe’s top professional golfers Robson Chinhoi is tipped to make it big and end up playing in more lucrative tours like the Asian and European Tours in the near future. This was said by Chinhoi’s former club-mate at Hillside Golf Club and fellow professional Biggie Chibvuri after the Mutare-born player finished tied second in the sixth leg of the 2021 Safari Tour golf series at the most challenging Great Rift Valley Golf Resort in Naiguya, Kenya, at the weekend. Chibvuri believes with the rate his friend is playing, he has a bright future and will carry the nation’s flag high. “Well played mate that was a good performance, future is bright looking forward to see you in the Asian Tour and European Tour very soon. Good grinding and approach to the greens keep the head down,” said Chibvuri. The sixth leg of the 2021 Safari Tour golf series was won by Kenyan Justus Madoya who beat Chinhoi and Thika Sports Club’s Simon Ngige by three shots, to claim the title. It was, however, a great finish for the Uganda Open champion Chinhoi who managed to overcome his second round disastrous 82, to shoot level par 71 which saw him tie for second place with Thika-based Ngige on six over par total of 290. “I had all the chances of playing well and win save for the bad round during the third round, but there are still three more events, and my plan is to play well in all of them for that will give me a good start in the Kenya Open,’’ said Chinhoi, who won the Uganda Open with an excellent score of 15 under par late last year. The second place finish further enhanced Chinhoi’s Road to Kenya Open chances as he is now sitting on position six of the order of merit.
