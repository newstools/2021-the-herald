The Herald Leroy Dzenga “It is easier to build strong children than repair broken men,” is a poignant quote attributed to Frederick Douglass, an American philosopher who fought hard for the abolition of slavery. The statement, though fact checkers have failed to tie it back to the Douglass, remains apt. Whoever coined it must have been inspired because the essence still holds true to date as is shown by St George’s College students who have been engaging in volunteering work within their respective communities. The students, who have over the years exhibited social empathy through a number of projects, are a product of a deliberate strategy by the institution to ensure that they instil a trait of service in all their alumni. They have a programme called “Men and Women for others” whose thrust entails that one cannot proceed to Advanced Level at the school without volunteering and participating in a community project. The requirement has seen the birth of interesting community interventions from St George’s students. One such student is Rumbidzai Mudzamiri who volunteered to be an assistant teacher at St Peter’s Primary School in Mbare. During her time at the school, she observed that the books were aging and decided to embark on a project to cover as well as mend torn books in the school library to ensure that they are in usable condition. “The idea of a service project helps young men and women to learn not to take what we have for granted. It is important to engage with the community and learn of the world beyond your everyday environment,” says Mudzamiri. She has rehabilitated the bulk of books at the school. Another student from the school, Tyler Hewitt, volunteered at Emerald Hill School for the Deaf. <img class="size-full wp-image-527331" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/01/Untitled-4.jpg-c.jpg" alt="" width="261" height="152" /> Tyler Hewitt He helped raise money to buy textbooks after realising that there was an acute textbook shortage at the school. Rector of St George’s College, Father Joe Arimoso, says that right from inception, Jesuit Priests set very high standards in the area of academics, cultural and extracurricular activities to ensure the achievement of all round excellence, a key tenet under girding Jesuit education. He says the school is premised on “the heart and mind to work with others for the good of all in the service of the Kingdom of God”. Perhaps the model could be adopted for other schools in the country as a reminder of humanity, beyond curriculum content. Volunteering has been identified as a key ingredient for development.
