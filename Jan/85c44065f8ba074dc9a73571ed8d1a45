The Herald ZIMBABWE international football striker Tino Kadewere ended his first year in the French Ligue 1 in style after one of his goals was named Goal of the Year at giants, Olympique Lyon, writes Eddie Chikamhi. The Lyon media yesterday announced the stylish back-heel in the Rhone-Alpes Derby against eternal rivals Saint Etienne last month was the best goal by any Lyon player last year. “Tino Kadewere’s clever derby finish is our 2020 Goal of the Year!” announced Lyon on their media channels yesterday. Olympique Lyon have scored a total of 34 goals before the Christmas break with Kadewere contributing seven. This has been a remarkable outing for the former Harare City star, who has found lots of support from his teammates to enable him to settle in quickly after joining them from second-tier side, Le Havre, at the beginning of the season. But the club settled for one of the derby goals when Kadewere helped Lyon to recover from a goal down to win against Saint Etienne. The Warriors forward came off the bench with almost an hour played and delivered a stunning performance which has now been eked in the history books of Lyon. The 24-year-old forward, who had replaced Moussa Dembele in the 57th minute, was only eight minutes into the game when he reacted quickly to a square ball in the box from a well-rehearsed free-kick at the edge of the box. Drawing away from his markers with a trademark off-the-ball run, Kadewere beat the goalkeeper hands down with his stylish finish off Maxwell Cornet’s pass. And the goal will be placed in the club’s archives. The honour comes just days after the former Harare City star was voted Lyon’s Best Signing for 2020 via a twitter poll. Fans reacted to an invitation by the club to vote for the revelation of the year 2020 on Twitter and Kadewere finished ahead of Brazilians Lucas Paqueta and Bruno Guimaraes. The former Le Havre striker won 42 percent of the votes while Paqueta polled 29 percent.  Guimaraes had 28 percent.
