The Herald JOHANNESBURG — South African police are investigating a possible international gold smuggling syndicate after three suspects were arrested at OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg on Tuesday with gold bars weighing 73.5kg in their carry-on luggage. The gold bullion, worth an estimated US$4.1 million, looked suspicious when the three put their bags through a security check, according to the police. “Upon questioning of the suspects and further inspection of their hand luggage, officials discovered the gold bars and some foreign currency,” said police spokesperson Col Athlenda Mathe. The suspects provided police with certification papers for the gold and South African authorities will work with Interpol and the countries involved to verify the origin and destination of the gold bars. “There is a possibility that money laundering and fraud charges will be brought against the three accused at a later stage,” said Mathe. – Yahoo News
