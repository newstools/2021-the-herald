The Herald LONDON. — Tottenham Hotspur boss Jose Mourinho said he senses the desire of his players to end the English Premiership football club’s 13-year trophy drought after they reached the League Cup final beating Championship side Brentford 2-0 on Tuesday night. Spurs have not lifted a major trophy since their League Cup triumph over Chelsea in 2008 and goals from Moussa Sissoko and Son Heung-min secured their ninth final appearance in the competition, which they have won four times. Mourinho, who is seeking his fifth League Cup crown as a manager after previous triumphs with Chelsea (2005, 2007, 2015) and Manchester United (2017), said there was a simple secret to success in the competition. Mourinho says taking the League Cup (also now known as the Carabao Cup) seriously is the key to his success in the competition after booking his fifth final appearance. — AFP.
