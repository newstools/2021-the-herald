The Herald TOKYO – The Tokyo 2020 Olympics faces further uncertainty due to the Japanese Government’s COVID-19 vaccination plans, with its roll out not expected until late February. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga suggested in a speech last week that vaccines are a “clincher” and promised to start vaccinations as soon as late February, with the Health Ministry expecting to approve the Pfizer vaccine by then. This would mean Japanese citizens would only start to receive vaccinations five months before the Games are set to start, on July 23.
Tokyo 2020 is then scheduled to end on August 8. The Games were postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In December, the United Kingdom became the first nation to approve a vaccination, with the first person vaccinated on December 8.
More than 50 nations are already administering COVID-19 vaccines. Domestic trials are required in Japan before a vaccine can be granted approval. Japan has secured enough vaccines for all its citizens after agreeing deals with pharmaceutical companies Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna. Pfizer is set to be approved in February, Moderna started its domestic trials on Thursday (January 21) while AstraZeneca has completed a trial but has not yet filed for approval. Suga also promised to provide “accurate information based on scientific findings, including side effects and efficacy” to address concerns of vaccine sceptics. In a study by Lancet published in September, Japan ranked among the lowest of 149 countries surveyed about vaccine confidence, with less than 25 per cent of people agreeing on vaccine safety, importance and effectiveness. Following the vaccination of priority citizens, the general public is expected to get access to the vaccine from May onwards. – Insidethegames.com
