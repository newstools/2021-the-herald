The Herald Senior Court Reporter A 46-year-old self-styled traditional healer appeared in court for breaking and entering a house in Warren Park 1, and stole various household properties including food items at night. Kesias Kondo, who is jointly charged with Muchuchusi Msimanga, appeared at the Harare Magistrates’ Court charged with unlawful entry in aggravated circumstances. The two were not asked to plead to the charges when they appeared before magistrate Mr Sheunesu Matova, who remanded them to March 1 on $2 500 bail each. Allegations against the duo are that on January 10 this year, during the night, went to a house in Warren Park 1 and found people sleeping. They allegedly broke a window and gained entry into the house and stole various household properties and $900. The following morning, the duo took a cellphone they had stolen to MacDonald Musoko- a cellphone dealer- for unlocking and flashing it. The duo intended to sell a pair of shoes that they had also stolen the previous night. The deal was out when Nkosilathi Zvidzai saw his girlfriend’s cellphone and questioned Kondo and Msimanga where they had got it from and they failed to give a good explanation leading to their arrest.
