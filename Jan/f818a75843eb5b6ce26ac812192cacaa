The Herald Prosper Dembedza Court Correspondent A director with Blasdale Investments, a clearing company based in Beitbridge was on Tuesday granted $20 000 bail on allegations of defrauding his client of 48 493 litres of petrol worth US$46 000 in a botched fuel transportation deal. Admire Chikowe (40) appeared before Harare magistrate Mr Sheunesu Matova. Mr Matova ordered Chikowe not to interfere with State witnesses and to continue residing at his given address. The State led by Mr Moses Mapanga had opposed bail and called Detective Moris Katiyo, who is the investigating officer, into the witness stand. Det Katiyo told the court that bail was being opposed because Chikowe was a flight risk. He said some of his accomplices were still at large and if granted bail, Chikowe might interfere with them or flee. Det Katiyo said Chikowe had a high propensity to commit similar offences if freed on bail. “The trucks in question are not yet located and, therefore, if granted bail, the accused might tamper with evidence,” he said. The court heard that on December 12 last year, Chikowe, working in connivance with his accomplices who are still at large, allegedly cleared two trucks with two trailers at Beitbridge Border Post. It is alleged that the trucks were carrying 48 493 litres of petrol each. The trucks, which were branded Cassandra Logistics, loaded the fuel in Mozambique and were in transit to Zambia. It is the State’s case that the accused persons used the complainant’s bonded company, Ishgold Investments T/A NDB Clearing and Forwarding, to clear the trucks with Zimra and the trucks were released on transit to Zambia. The court heard that the accused persons tampered with the seals of the truck and made the trucks to offload at an unknown place in Zimbabwe as the trucks were never acquitted at Chirundu Border Post. As a result of the accused’s actions, the complainant suffered an actual prejudice of US$46 000.
