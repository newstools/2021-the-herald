The Herald CHRISTCHURCH. — Towering paceman Kyle Jamieson completed an 11-wicket match haul yesterday as New Zealand thrashed Pakistan in the second Test cricket to become the world’s top-ranked team. Jamieson was near unplayable in Pakistan’s second innings, finishing with six for 48 after his five for 69 in the first innings, to give New Zealand victory by an innings and 176 runs. The win inside four days in Christchurch, which completed a 2-0 series sweep, also confirmed New Zealand had overtaken Australia to be the world’s No. 1 Test side for the first time. “It’s hard to beat really,” said victorious captain Kane Williamson, whose double century set up the win. New Zealand batted Pakistan out of contention with a first-innings 659 for six, with Williamson’s masterful 238 supported by Henry Nicholls (157) and Daryl Mitchell (102 not out). But there was still a chance Pakistan could force a draw until Jamieson took the ball. — AFP.
