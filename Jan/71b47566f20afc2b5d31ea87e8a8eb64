The Herald The Confederation of Zimbabwe Retailers (CZR) said yesterday it has received positive feedback that the retail and  wholesale sectors are complying with the lockdown  regulations. Zimbabwe re-introduced a stringent lockdown this month as cases of Covid-19 rose sharply at the end of last year. The country first introduced a strict lockdown in March last year but  had gradually eased the restrictions as the disease appeared to be under control. CZR president Mr Denford Matashu said a survey which they carried out found that since the lockdown began most shops had ensured that wearing of face masks was compulsory to employees and customers. “Most retail outlets and wholesales have ensured that customer traffic into shops is limited to promote social distancing while the number of canteen chairs was reduced and spaced in the process,” he said. Mr Mutashu said temperature checks at entrances were mandatory with many  retailers installing screen guards at till points to reduce direct interface between operators and customers while each serving area was sanitised. He said till operators were sanitising their hands constantly after handling cash and customers’ swipe cards. Most shops were pre-packing fruits and vegetables to prevent customers from touching them with bare hands thereby lowering risks of spreading  the Covid-19 virus. “It is encouraging that shops have complied with opening and closing times of 8am to 3pm,” said Mr Mutashu. He urged customers to do their shopping within the stipulated times and  avoid rushing to shops towards closing times. Mr Mutashu urged the public to religiously wear face masks, sanitise, practice social distancing and avoid unnecessary movements. — New Ziana.
