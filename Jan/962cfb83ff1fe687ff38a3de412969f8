The Zimbabwe Musical Awards (Zima) nominees are out. The list was announced by television presenter Arthur Evans today and already there was debate on social media on some of the nominees. However, it seems the year 2020 was for youngsters like Poptain, Nutty O, Anita Jackson, Holy Ten and Jah Master among others who gave the “old dogs” in the industry a run for the limelight and talent.
