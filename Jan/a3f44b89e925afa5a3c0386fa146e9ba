The Herald Fungai Lupande Mash Central Bureau Government will avail 40 tractors to Agriculture and Rural Development Authority (ARDA) to assist in capacitating small holder irrigation schemes, Lands, Agriculture, Water and Rural Resettlement Minister Dr Anxious Masuka revealed. Speaking at Nyamuseve Irrigation Scheme recently Dr Masuka said Government is revamping and transforming small holder irrigation schemes to achieve 200 hectares per district per year target. Dr Masuka said the means to achieve an upper middle class economy by 2030 is through increase agriculture production. “The President pronounced that he wants to achieve 200 hectares per district per year. His view was that if people have 200 hectares of irrigable land and they plant a cereal crop we will get 2 000 tonnes of maize per district,” said Dr Masuka. “This means that districts will no longer be relying on the Department of Social Welfare. Therefore, 60 districts multiplied by 2 000 tonnes we get 120 000 tonnes. Social welfare demand is 37 000 tonnes of grain monthly. Currently they are distributing 17 000 to 18 000.” Dr Masuka said this irrigation concept will meet three quarters of social welfare requirements to reduce the burden. Irrigable area under various schemes in the country is 26 000 hectares.
