The Herald ZIMBABWE-BORN British boxer Derek Chisora and Joseph Parker have expressed their desire for fresh talks about a rescheduled fight after a spider bite scuppered their heavyweight showdown. Chisora was set to face Parker in October 2019, only for the fight to be cancelled after the New Zealander’s preparations were ruined by a three-week illness, with photos appearing to confirm a spider bite on his leg. But Parker is currently preparing for a fight against Kiwi rival Junior Fa on February 27, which could pave the way for a long-awaited showdown with Chisora. “I’ve heard some noises and frankly that is a fight with interest,” Parker’s manager David Higgins told Sky Sports. “We’d endorse it and there is interest from Parker, and our management team would endorse it. “There was a lot of talk in the past. The fight was contracted at one point. I think that fight makes sense.” Chisora emerged with credit from a battling points loss to Ukrainian star Oleksandr Usyk in October, and remains open to fighting Parker, the former WBO champion. “I’ve made no secret that I want the fight with Parker,” Chisora told Sky Sports. “I signed the fight, flew to his camp in LA to film only for him to chicken out and claim a spider bite was the reason he couldn’t step in the ring with me. “The truth is, when sat across the table, looking in my eyes, reality hit, he wasn’t ready for the WAR I bring. If fight fans want it, I’m game. He can come to me this time. This fight happens on my turf.” – Agencies
