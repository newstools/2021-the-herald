The Herald Thupeyo Muleya Beitbridge Bureau A man who went on the run for four days after allegedly raping a 14-year-old girl in Beitbridge has been arrested by police and found with an illegal firearm. Felix Zinyama (21) of Dulivhadzimu suburb, allegedly raped the girl at knife-point on January 14, before going into hiding. Zinyama was not asked to plead to charges of rape and illegal possession of a firearm when he appeared before Miss Vavariro Gabi yesterday and was remanded in custody to February 25.Â  Prosecutor, Mr Oswell Arufandi told the court that on Thursday last week, Zinyama, who stays in the same neighbourhood as the girl, saw her in the bush. He then called the girl and walked with her to a secluded area, where he raped her once at knife-point. Zinyama is also alleged to have threatened to kill the girl if she reported the matter to anyone and then disappeared for four days. Zinyama ran out of luck on Monday this week, when police officers on patrol in Dulivhadzimu suburb, received a tip-off on his whereabouts. They raided the house where he was hiding and found him asleep and arrested him. A routine search of his room led to the discovery of an unlicensed Star pistol with an empty magazine. The firearm was taken into police custody, pending further investigations.
