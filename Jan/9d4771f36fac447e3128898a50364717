The Herald LONDON. — Another away game against a relegation-threatened side, another superb strike from Paul Pogba to secure victory for Manchester United. Just as at Burnley a week or so ago, here at Fulham the France international produced another moment of magic to retain United’s two-point lead at the top of the English Premier League football table. Not since Pogba was tearing up Serie A in a Juventus shirt back in 2015 has he scored a strike from outside the area with his weaker left foot, but such is the confidence he is playing with now, he is willing to try almost anything when in shooting range. It has been a long time coming, but the 27-year-old is finally showing the kind of form that made United want to bring him back to Old Trafford for a world record-breaking £90 million in the summer of 2016. Many times over the past four-and-a-half years that price tag has been brought into question, but in his current form few will be complaining about how much Pogba cost after his performances over the last month. In fact, his displays are only helping ensure that United will recoup that fee and more if they do indeed sell the midfielder his summer. The only black mark on a perfect report sheet over the past few weeks for Pogba was the chance his missed late on against Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday. Had he beaten Alisson Becker, he would now have scored three winning goals on the road in the space of eight days. Bruno Fernandes has been marked out as United’s sole match-winner for much of the past 12 months, but Pogba is finally stepping up to take some of the weight of the Portuguese’s shoulders. — Goal.com
