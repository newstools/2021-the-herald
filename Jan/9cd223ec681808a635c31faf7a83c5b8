The Herald Fidelis Munyoro Chief Court Reporter Suspended Harare City finance director Tendai Kwenda finally got a reprieve after the Supreme Court granted him $50 000 bail pending a trial on corruption charges. Kwenda was arrested last year on allegations of transferring US$70 000 meant for the provision of water, sanitation, education and recreational services into his personal account and later purchased a top-of-the range vehicle. Early this month, Kwenda unsuccessfully applied for bail before Justice Benjamin Chikowero, who rejected his application on the grounds that he was not suitable for bail and was likely to abscond and interfere with investigations. Through his lawyer, Mr Joel Mambara, Kwenda took the matter up to the Supreme Court. Acting judge of Appeal, Justice Alfas Chitakunye, on Friday overturned the High Court decision and granted him bail pending trial coupled with stiff conditions. Apart from depositing $50 000 bail, Kwenda was ordered to reside at his Greystone Park home until the matter is finalised. He is also required to report to the nearest police station every Friday between 6am and 6pm and was barred from interfering with witnesses and investigations. In addition, the court ordered him to surrender title deeds to his other Greystone Park house. Charges against Kwenda arose on October 30, 2014, when he allegedly connived with other council top executives to transfer funds into his personal account from council’s Traditional Beer Levy account. The misappropriated funds were not part of council’s general revenue but were meant for community welfare as approved by the Minister of Local Govenment and Public Works. Kwenda is further alleged to have purchased a Jeep Cherokee without the minister’s approval, a council resolution or procurement procedures that call for a tender process. Mr Austin Muzivi appeared for the State.
