The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter SEASONED golf coach Roger Baylis has tipped upcoming Zimbabwe junior golfer Keegan Shutt as a future prospect for golf in Zimbabwe. Shutt recently joined KeNako Golf Academy in George, South Africa, where he has been doing well in junior tournaments. The 14-year-old was groomed at Baylis’ Chapman-based Leadbetter Golf Academy. Shutt is a Zimbabwe national team player in the age-group sides and will be part of the All Africa Junior Championship to be played in Cairo, Egypt, in April. His has moved to enhance his form by joining an active association as golf has been frozen back home in Zimbabwe following the directive by the Government to suspend all sporting activities to curb the recent spike in the Covid-19 cases. Baylis said the 14-year-old, who won the Nomads SA Under-15 Championship at Selbourne Golf Club last week, is a distinct young talent. “I am happy to have worked with Keegan and he is a real fighter who works for the team. He is a promising leader and has done well in the junior tournaments which he played locally. “Keegan has got a lot of talent. He is only 14-years-old and is already in the top 10 in the order of merit. He has already played at the highest level in Scotland for Zimbabwe in the juniors. “I can safely say we are going to have a top player if everything goes according to plan. The boy is very talented and can rise to the occasion. I remember him winning the last junior tournaments we held by 29 clear shots. At the moment he is still developing and if he keeps his head down we are going to witness one of the finest golfers the country has ever produced,” said Baylis.
