The Herald SIMBA SC have completed the signing of Highlanders defender Peter Muduhwa ahead of the resumption of the Tanzania Mainland League. The 21-time Tananian champions have been strengthening their squad to ensure they meet their set targets in the ongoing 2020/21 campaign. Wekundu wa Msimbazi have confirmed the arrival of the Zimbabwean player a day before the start of the Simba Super Cup. “Welcome to the big family of Tanzania champions defender Peter Muduhwa ‘Master of Defense'” Simba confirmed on their official social media sites. “We as the Simba family welcome you with both hands and we believe you will help us perform well in the Caf Champions League and the Simba Super Cup. “Muduhwa, who joins us from Zimbabwean outfit Highlanders FC, has arrived to seal the deal from Cameroon where he was representing Zimbabwe in the (African Nations Competition).” ‘The Master of Defense’ played in two Group A matches for the Warriors but was not involved in the 1-0 loss to Mali. He was commanding the back four as the Zdravko Logarusic-led charges lost by a solitary goal to the Indomitable Lions in their opening game. They then fell 3-1 to Burkina Faso in their second game and as a result, they were eliminated from the competition. On Monday, the Msimbazi-based charges also confirmed the signing of Junior Lokosa as the team aims at reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League. The East African heavyweights were pooled with the Democratic Republic of Congo outfit in Group A alongside defending champions Al Ahly and Sudanese heavyweights El-Merreikh in a draw conducted at the Caf headquarters in Cairo, Egypt on Friday, January 8. – Goal.com
