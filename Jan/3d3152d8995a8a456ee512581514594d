THE Warriors sunk to a new low after they finished as the bottom-ranked team at the CHAN tournament currently underway in Cameroon. Zdravko Logarusic’s side were the only team that finished without, at least, securing a point in the group games.  They were in Group A alongside hosts Cameroon, Burkina Faso and Mali. Zimbabwe lost 0-1 to Cameroon in the opening match before succumbing to a 1-3 defeat at the hands of Burkina Faso in their second game.  The Warriors completed the group stages with a 0-1 defeat by Mali, who topped the pool and progressed to the quarter-finals alongside hosts Cameroon. Namibia were the only other team that had not won a game but they managed to get a point when they drew 0-0 with Zambia in their last Group D match on Wednesday.  Uganda also finished with one point in Group C while Libya also anchored their group with two points.
The Warriors have since returned home. The quarter-finals of the tournament are scheduled to begin tomorrow.
