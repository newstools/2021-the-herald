The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo Senior Arts Reporter After the MTV Africa Music Awards (MAMA) announced their nominations last month with South Africa-based Zimbabwean “Amapiano queen”, Sha Sha vying for the Best Breakthrough Act, it emerged that another Zimbabwean star still has a crack at the awards as local fans are to decide the musician to be nominated for the Listeners Choice Award. Apparently, some people were confused over the listener’s choice category with word doing rounds on the social media purporting that Zimdancehall sensation Winky D, Bulawayo-based rapper, ASAPH, songstress Gemma Griffiths, Sha Sha and multi-award winner Jah Prayzah have been shortlisted to represent Zimbabwe in the Listeners Choice Award at the MAMAs’. What raised eyebrows was that only Zimbabwean artistes had been nominated in that category and worse still, checking on the MAMAs’ website the category has not been updated? The actual truth is that, yes those four are competing against themselves first to be voted by their fans in their country. <img class="size-full wp-image-523405" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/01/Untitled-4-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/01/Untitled-4-1.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/01/Untitled-4-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Asaph The one with the most votes then automatically qualifies to be in the Listeners Choice Category with other contenders representing their countries. Zimbabweans are supposed to vote for an artiste who will eventually becomes a nominee at continental level. The nominee stands a chance to win the coveted Listener’s Choice Award. Then the winners from different countries will then be on the updated category and be voted by everyone. Of those vying for the category back home, some of them have already started their campaigns to rally for votes. The awards, which are in their seventh edition, will be held virtually on February 20 in Kampala, Uganda, and will broadcast on the MTV Base and MTV channels.
