The Herald BOXER Revai Madondo left the country on Tuesday for Tanzania where she will fight Stumai Muki on Friday at the Rumble-in-Dar event.
The main event will be the WBF International super-featherweight match between Ibrahim Class and Dennis Mwale. Madondo will trade leather with Muki in one of the several supporting bouts. It is going to be her first fight outside Zimbabwe. Madondo revealed she was unfazed by the prospects of fighting on foreign soil. “I am just going to assume I am fighting a local fight but the boxing ring is the same and it will just be the two of us in that ring. I have high expectations for this fight and I am much in need of a win to take my boxing career to another level. “I am very much prepared. Come Friday night I want to fly Zimbabwe’s flag high and make Zimbabweans proud,” she said.
Madondo is accompanied on the trip by her trainer Clyde Musonda, who is confident she will pull through as they seek to go for a WBF international fight in April. “We have watched the opponent’s previous fights and she is not a threat. We are taking the fight seriously because a win for Revai will see her going to fight Mariela Ribera Valverde in a WBF international super flyweight match in April. “Revai is dedicated to training…I believe that one day her dreams will come true, she has got a bright future and she is disciplined,” Musonda said. Madondo’s last fight was on December 26 last year when she fought Kudakwashe Chivandire at a charity event in Harare.
