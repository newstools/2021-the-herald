The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter HORSE racing family will return to Borrowdale Park and Racecourse on Sunday for the 2021 opening race meeting which will be headlined by the Hachiman Sprint. The Hachiman Sprint will be run over 1 100m with six runners expected to take to the starting stalls. The field will include two-time Gold Cup winner, Verdier, and Christofle, the defending champion who won the race in 2019 before the sport was suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic national lockdown. Gladstone, a whisker behind Verdier in the 1 200m Gold Cup on December 11, is also there, along with What A Dandy who managed a place in the same race before. Love To Bluff and Golden Lion — who like to make surprises from time to time — complete the future race field. The course is reported to be in favourable condition with the inspectors reporting that on December 20 it was soft underfoot, penetrometer reading 29, but since then the course has had a chance to recover. The first race on Sunday is at 12:15 and the Hachiman Sprint is due off at 15:55. The two races prior to the Hachiman are also mind-boggling, but once punters have recovered from their hangovers on Saturday, they will be better placed to make their selections with the help of the online Borrowdale card.
