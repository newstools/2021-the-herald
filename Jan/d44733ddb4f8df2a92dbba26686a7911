The Herald LONDON – The International Olympic Committee (IOC) will reportedly ban the Italian flag and anthem from Tokyo 2020 if a dispute over Government interference in the country’s National Olympic Committee is not resolved by Wednesday (January 27). According to Italian newspaper la Repubblica, the IOC Executive Board is set to impose a series of measures on the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) when it holds its next meeting. CONI President Giovanni Malagò appeared to confirm the country could face IOC sanctions when speaking in front of the Italian Senate today, warning an intervention by the Government “is needed to stop any decision of the IOC”.
Malagò, an IOC member, has urged Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to issue an emergency decree to prevent CONI from being sanctioned. A ban on the Italian flag and anthem at Tokyo 2020, effectively consigning the country to the same status at the Games as Russia, is among the punishments the IOC could impose on CONI. A spokesperson for the IOC told insidethegames they were confident the issue would be resolved before the Executive Board meets on Wednesday. The dispute between CONI and the IOC comes after the Italian Parliament approved a draft sports law which created a Government-controlled organisation to distribute funds to the country’s national governing bodies – a role previously held by CONI. The IOC has repeatedly raised concerns over the formation by the Italian Government of the body – “Sport e Salute”, or Sport and Health – as it claims it represents interference in an NOC, strictly prohibited under the Olympic Charter. – Insidethegames.com
