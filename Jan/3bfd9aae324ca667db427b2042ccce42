The Herald Court Reporter THE trial of a commuter omnibus driver, who hit and killed two pedestrians before ramming into two other vehicles after defying Covid-19 restrictions banning kombis not registered with Zupco from operating, is expected to kick-off today at the Harare Magistrates’ Court. Ernest Kazingizi (27) is expected to appear before magistrate Ms Tendai Muchini charged with culpable homicide in aggravating circumstances. The trial was set to open last Friday but was deferred to today after the State led by Mr Isheunesu Mhiti, indicated they wanted to amend the charge sheet and outline to include information on how Kazingizi caused the accident after disobeying traffic lights and proceeded against a red robot, resulting in the accident. It is said that on December 1, 2020 at around 6:30am, Kazingizi was driving a Toyota Hiace (ADZ 0303) along Nelson Mandela Street due east in Harare’s CBD. Upon reaching the intersection of Nelson Mandela and Angwa streets, Kazingizi failed to give way to traffic coming from the right and hit a Mercedes Benz that was travelling along Angwa Street due north. Due to the impact of the collision, Kazingizi lost control of his kombi and hit Zvidzai Hungwe and Greenfield Kundodyiwa who were crossing the road. Kazingizi’s also rammed into another Toyota Raum which was parked along Nelson Mandela. Hungwe and Kundodyiwa were taken to Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals where they later died because of wounds they sustained after being hit by Kazingizi.
