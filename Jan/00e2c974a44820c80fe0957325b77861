The Herald The board of the Zimbabwe  Revenue Authority (Zimra) yesterday announced the start of a hunt  for a new commissioner general to replace Ms Faith Mazani who leaves  at the end of this month. Ms Mazanhi, who leaves the tax collector after having been in charge for three years, is taking up a new post at the International Monetary  Fund (IMF) next month. She is lauded for reforming the organisation to enhance its efficiency  and for having consistently led the State revenue collector to surpass  set targets. The Zimra board said the new commissioner general must be able to  “provide strategic, proactive and effective leadership for the  authority’s leadership.” The new commissioner general will also be required to broaden the  revenue base as well as push for the automation of processes. Ability to establish mutually beneficial relationships with key  organisations such as the African Development Bank, International  Monetary Fund, World Bank among others is also a key requirement. Zimra was established in 2001 and its key role is to act as an agent of the State in assessing, collecting and to enforce payment of all  revenues and advising government on matters relating to raising and collection of revenues. — New Ziana.
