The Herald BARCELONA. — Lionel Messi has avoided a lengthy ban after collecting the first red card of his Barcelona career, with the Argentine set to sit out just two games on the back of his Spanish Super Cup dismissal against Athletic Club, but the Blaugrana will still be lodging an appeal. The RFEF, which controls disciplinary matters in Spain, has ruled that the six-time Ballon d’Or winner will not have to serve a lengthy suspension for lashing out at Asier Villalibre. It had been suggested that the mercurial South American could face up to 12 games stuck on the sidelines as a result of his reckless actions. The match officials and RFEF have, however, decided that there was no aggression on the part of Messi, meaning that standard sentences will be implemented. Carmen Perez, president of the Competition Committee, was put in sole charge of passing a ruling on Messi. The RFEF only presides over league matters in Spain, with Messi’s misdemeanour occurring in cup action. Perez has listened to the arguments put forward by Barca regarding their talismanic captain and decided that two games in the stands will be enough. As a result, Messi is due to sit out meetings with Cornella in the Copa del Rey and Elche in La Liga. — Goal.com
