The Herald Washington, United States – Lady Gaga launched Joe Biden’s inauguration ceremony by belting out a classic rendition of the US national anthem, donning a billowing ball gown and enormous dove brooch. The long-sleeved gown, reportedly Schiaparelli, featured a fitted navy drop-waist bodice with a demure mock neck collar, a look completed with a voluminous scarlet skirt that ensured she kept her Covid-friendly distance. “My intention is to acknowledge our past, be healing for our present, and passionate for a future where we work together lovingly. I will sing to the hearts of all people who live on this land,” Gaga tweeted ahead of her performance. Following Gaga’s performance of “The Star-Spangled Banner” Jennifer Lopez took the stage, performing Woody Guthrie’s classic “This Land Is Your Land”, a tune with socialist leanings the folk legend is said to have written in response to the more nationalistic “God Bless America.” Bronx-raised with Puerto Rican roots, Lopez finished with “America The Beautiful”, adding in a line of Spanish: “Siempre con libertad y justicia para todos” (“Liberty and justice for all, always”). Sporting a white pantsuit ensemble with a lace ruffle collar, reportedly Chanel, Lopez also shouted “Let’s get loud!” During her performance, a nod to her turn-of-the-millennium signature hit, delighting social media. — www.iol.co.za
