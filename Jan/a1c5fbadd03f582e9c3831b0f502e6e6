The Herald GENEVA. — The director general of the World Health Organisation (WHO)Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned that the inequitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines between rich and poor countries will prolong the pandemic. He slammed wealthier countries for buying up and hoarding all the available vaccines. “More than 39 million doses of vaccine have now been administered in at least 49 higher-income countries. Just 25 doses have been given in one lowest-income country. Not 25 million; not 25 000; just 25,” Tedros said at the opening of a week-long meeting of the WHO Executive Board on Monday. The WHO chief blasted vaccine manufacturers for chasing regulatory approvals “where the profits are highest,” rather than seeking global approval with the WHO. “I need to be blunt:  the world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure — and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world’s poorest countries,” he added. Last week, the global death toll from Covid-19 surpassed 2 million, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. — DW.
