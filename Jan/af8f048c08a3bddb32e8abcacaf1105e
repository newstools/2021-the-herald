The Herald Blessings Chidakwa Herald Reporter Peddling of fake news on the death and ill health of prominent members of society be it for political mileage or whatever reason does not resemble the spirit of ubuntu that is part and parcel of Zimbabwean culture, a Cabinet Minister has said. In a weekly Covid-19 taskforce statement, Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Acting Minister Dr Jenfan Muswere said it is saddening that the proliferation of fake news continues unabated all for the sake of scoring cheap political mileage. “To this end, social media has been awash with fake news of deaths and ill health of prominent members of society, including celebrating the deaths of some amongst us. “Without unity of purpose and a common vision in fighting the disease we will all perish. To this end, we call upon all Zimbabweans to remember the notion of ubuntu ‘l am, because we are’, now more than ever, we need each other and we need a shared national vision,” said Minister Muswere. He also expressed serious concern over the increased number of people that are flouting the national lockdown regulations as 19 000 more people were arrested for violating lockdown regulations countrywide compared to the other preceding week.  On lockdown violators, Minister Muswere said: ” As of January 20, 2021, a total of 347 264 arrests were made countrywide for flouting lockdown regulations, indicating an increase of 19 188, from the 328 076 that was recorded the previous week. This problem is prevalent at funerals.”
