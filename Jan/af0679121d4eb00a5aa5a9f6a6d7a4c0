The Herald WASHINGTON. – The US Congress yesterday confirmed President-elect Joe Biden’s November 3 election victory over President Donald Trump, clearing the way for Biden’s inauguration. Vice President Mike Pence certified the electoral college tally of 306 electors in favour of Biden against 232 in favour of outgoing President Donald Trump. Early yesterday morning, Trump for the first time acknowledged his defeat in the election and announced there would be an “orderly transition on January 20th”. Trump’s acknowledgment came after a day of chaos and destruction on Capitol Hill when his supporters stormed the Capitol, forced members into hiding and halted the formal (and ceremonial) congressional tally for more than six hours. Proceedings resumed at about 8pm  with Vice President Mike Pence, bringing the Senate session back into order, and addressing the rioters who smashed in windows and trespassed into lawmakers’ offices and the House and Senate chambers. “To those who wreaked havoc at our Capitol today, you did not win,” Pence said. “Violence never wins. Freedom wins. And this is still the people’s house.” Trump’s begrudging statement acknowledging defeat came after even long-time allies floated whether members of his Cabinet should invoke the 25th Amendment and remove him from office. The 25th Amendment formally outlines the transition of power if a sitting president is unable or deemed unfit to serve. Article 4 allows for the removal of a president who is deemed incapacitated by any kind of illness — including mental illness — or injury. The Vice-President and a majority of the president’s cabinet would have to support the decision. – Yahoo News.
