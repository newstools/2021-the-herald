The Herald LONDON – English Premiership football giants Chelsea are set to sack manager Frank Lampard today after the club’s recent poor form. The former England midfielder has spent 18 months at the helm at Stamford Bridge and he impressed during his first full season as manager, guiding the club to fourth in the Premier League despite a transfer ban. However, after a similarly decent start to the current campaign, Chelsea’s form has collapsed over the last two months and they’ve won just one of their last five matches in the Premier League. That’s left Chelsea 9th in the league table, on 29 points at the halfway stage of the campaign and owner Roman Abramovich has decided to sack Lampard, according to the Telegraph. – Metro
