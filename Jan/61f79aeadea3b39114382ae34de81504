The Herald Conrad Mupesa Mashonaland West Bureau Mashonaland West isolation centre equipped with modern machinery was today officially opened as the province moves to arrest Covid-19 fatal cases. The centre, located at Chinhoyi Provincial Hospital, seeks to services all the districts in the province and has state-of-the-art equipment which was supplied by the Government, Chinese Embassy and the mining giants Zimplats and Dreat Dyke Investments (GDI). The multi-million dollar fifty-five bed isolation centre was completed in eight months instead of three due to bureaucratic procurement procedure and slow funds release. Officially opening the isolation centre, Minister of State of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution and Mashonaland West Covid-19 task force team chairperson Mary Mliswa- Chikoka said the centre will help save lives. <img class="size-full wp-image-527269" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/01/WhatsApp-Image-2021-01-29-at-17.24.50.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/01/WhatsApp-Image-2021-01-29-at-17.24.50.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/01/WhatsApp-Image-2021-01-29-at-17.24.50-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Provincial equipment procurement officer, Mr Mathias Chaima explains how some of the machines work to Minister Mliswa Chikoka. “The centre will help save lives and decongest Harare health institutions,” she said. Chinhoyi Provincial Hospital superintendent, Dr Collet Mawire said a ‘supermarket approach’ has been adopted in the isolation centre’s operations as males, females, pediatrician, maternity and executive wards will be under one roof to avoid further spreading of the disease. He said the hospital had 69 of its staff testing positive for the virus and a ward for the staff was also introduced to improve moral of the workers at the institution. “We are ready to receive Covid-19 patients and as you can see the centre is fully equipped with modern equipment. Although it is not enough, it can help to make things roll,” he said. Provincial development coordinator, Mr Josphat Jaji said Karoi district isolation centre will be ready for commissioning next week while efforts to expedite completion of other centres across the province were on course.
