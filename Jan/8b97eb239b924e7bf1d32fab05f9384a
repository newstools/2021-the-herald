At least 250 families in Chiredzi will be forced to temporarily leave their homes along the banks of Runde River as Tugwi-Mukosi Dam level continues to swell, raising the spectre of flooding in downstream areas. By end of day, Zimbabwe’s largest inland dam was almost 92 percent full pointing to inevitable spilling in the coming few days as heavy rains in the catchment area continue to push more inflows in the water body. The Civil Protection Unit (CPU) is already on high alert preparing for the worst with an Air Force of Zimbabwe chopper on standby to airlift families who might be affected if Runde River burst its banks from high water volumes from Tugwi River, which is its tributary. Spilling in Tugwi-Mukosi Dam will increase water volumes in Tugwi River, downstream of the water body, which in turn will also release its load in Runde raising prospects of flooding in Chiredzi where the river snakes through on it’s way to joining Save River in Gonarezhou National Park. There is also a possibility of back flow in Tugwi as Runde is in flood, a situation that might affect communities around the confluence of the two rivers in Chiredzi North.
