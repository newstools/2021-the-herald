The Herald BUENOS AIRES (AFP) – Diego Maradona’s personal doctor did forge the football star’s signature to get copies of his medical records, prosecutors have confirmed. Leopoldo Luque was nailed by handwriting experts called in to examine documents seized in a raid on his home and office. They proved he had forged the signature in a request for pre-op records from a clinic in September, the prosecutor’s office in Argentina capital Buenos Aires said. World Cup winner Maradona died at his home in November last year aged 60 following a heart attack after a brain op. Luque (39) has denied claims of wrongdoing from Maradona’s family, who suggest he was not properly cared for.
