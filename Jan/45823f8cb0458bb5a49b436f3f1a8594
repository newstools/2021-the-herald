The Herald Conrad Mupesa Mashonaland West Bureau A THIRTY-FIVE-YEAR-OLD woman from Chinhoyi who turned her house into a flashy shebeen and butchery was nabbed on Wednesday as security intensifies lockdown regulations. Mirriam Watongwa was charged with operating a business establishment during the Covid-19 national lockdown, owning a shebeen and keeping and selling uninspected meat. She is expected to appear in court soon. Provincial police spokesperson, Inspector Margaret Chitove said the suspect was arrested after a tip off from the locals. “Police reacted to a tip off from the members of the public and raided house number 5591 White City high density suburb around 2pm. The few patrons who were imbibing managed to escape,” she said. She said police later searched the house which she had turned into a shebeen and butchery; and found nine crates of beer, 130 kg of carcass meat and two ox-heads. Inspector Chitove warned those operating shebeens, illegal transport owners, vendors along the roads and those defying and violating lockdown regulations that the long arm of the law would catch-up with them. She also said police had arrested several Level Four lockdown regulation violators since its inception on January 5.
