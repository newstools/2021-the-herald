The Herald YAOUNDE – Burkina Faso revived their hopes of reaching the quarter-finals of the African Nations Championship in Cameroon when beating an ill-prepared Zimbabwe 3-1 late on Wednesday night. The Stallions recovered from their opening day defeat to win the Group A football match in Yaounde and put life into their chances of advancing from the group. The result means Warriors are out of the competition with no points after two matches and their final group match against Mali on Sunday will be a mere formality. Issouf Sosso put Burkina Faso the lead after 14 minutes with a low shot that beat Zimbabwe’s goalkeeper Simbarashe Chinani. But the Warriors roared back into the game in the 23rd minute making it 1-1 with a well-worked goal by Partson Jaure after several passes in the box. The West Africans continued to attack in numbers, but they missed some glaring scoring chances before the break. The Stallions stepped up their game in the second half to dominate play as they pushed deep into Zimbabwe’s area and created several chances. It was no surprise when Claver Tiendrebeogo made it 2-1 for Burkina Faso after 53 minutes following a defensive howler by the Warriors. Pawel Govere and Ian Nekato later had their shots blocked by the Burkina Faso goalkeeper Adama Sawadogo midway through the half before substitute Issiaka Quedraogo got his name on the score sheet to brighten their chances of reaching the last eight. Burkina Faso are now in third place with three points while Cameroon and Mali who played out to a 1-1 draw earlier in the day are tied on four points apiece.
