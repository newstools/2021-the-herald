The Herald Bulawayo Bureau A forty-eight-YEAR-OLD woman from Matobo District in Matabeleland South Province, allegedly forced her 13-year-old daughter to sleep with her 36-year-old live-in boyfriend to save her relationship, resulting in the girl falling pregnant. The pair tried to conceal the offence, which happened over five years ago, by threatening to kill the girl if she reported the matter to anyone. The complainant’s child, who is a product of the rape, is now five-years-old. This emerged when the woman approached the High Court seeking bail pending trial. She allegedly connived with her boyfriend so that he could sleep with her daughter, after the boyfriend had threatened to ditch her because of her age. The woman then offered the boyfriend her daughter as a “second wife”, as a condition for him not to end their affair. The woman, through her lawyer Mr Bruce Masamvu of Mutatu, Masamvu and Da Silva-Gustavo Law Chambers, filed an application for bail pending trial at the Bulawayo High Court citing the State as a respondent. Bulawayo High Court judge Justice Thompson Mabhikwa granted the bail after the State did not oppose. She was released on $2 000 bail and ordered to continue residing at her given address and not interfere with State witnesses until the matter is finalised. In her bail statement, the woman denied the charge, arguing that she did not participate in the crime. She said her boyfriend implicated her as a way of trying to fix her after she reported him to the police for raping her daughter.
